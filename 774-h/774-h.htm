ix</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the exception of the <i>Poems
in Prose</i> this volume does not contain anything which the
author ever contemplated reprinting.&nbsp; <i>The Rise of
Historical Criticism</i> is interesting to admirers of his work,
however, because it shows the development of his style and the
wide intellectual range distinguishing the least
<i>born&eacute;</i> of all the late Victorian writers, with the
possible exception of Ruskin.&nbsp; It belongs to Wilde&rsquo;s
Oxford days when he was the unsuccessful competitor for the
Chancellor&rsquo;s English Essay Prize.&nbsp; Perhaps Magdalen,
which has never forgiven herself for nurturing the author of
<i>Ravenna</i>, may be felicitated on having escaped the further
intolerable honour that she might have suffered by seeing crowned
again with paltry academic parsley the most highly gifted of all
her children in the last century.</p>
<p>Of the lectures, I have only included those which exist, so
far as I know, in manuscript; the reports of others in
contemporary newspapers being untrustworthy.&nbsp; They were
usually delivered <a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>from notes and were repeated at various towns in England
and America.&nbsp; Here will be found the origin of
Whistler&rsquo;s charges of plagiarism against the author.&nbsp;
How far they are justified the reader can decide for himself,
Wilde always admitted that, relying on an old and intimate
friendship, he asked the artist&rsquo;s assistance on one
occasion for a lecture he had failed to prepare in time.&nbsp;
This I presume to be the Address delivered to the Art Students of
the Royal Academy in 1883, as Whistler certainly reproduced some
of it as his own in the &lsquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock&rsquo; lecture
delivered subsequently, in 1885.&nbsp; To what extent an idea may
be regarded as a perpetual gift, or whether it is ethically
possible to retrieve an idea like an engagement ring, it is not
for me to discuss.&nbsp; I would only point out once more that
all the works by which Wilde is known throughout Europe were
written after the two friends had quarrelled.&nbsp; That Wilde
derived a great deal from the older man goes without saying, just
as he derived so much in a greater degree from Pater, Ruskin,
Arnold and Burne-Jones.&nbsp; Yet the tedious attempt to
recognise in every jest of his some original by Whistler induces
the criticism that it seems a pity the great painter did not get
them off on the public before <a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>he was forestalled.&nbsp; Reluctance
from an appeal to publicity was never a weakness in either of the
men.&nbsp; Some of Wilde&rsquo;s more frequently quoted sayings
were made at the Old Bailey (though their provenance is often
forgotten) or on his death-bed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the genius of the two men was entirely
different.&nbsp; Wilde was a humourist and a humanist before
everything; and his wittiest jests have neither the
relentlessness nor the keenness characterising those of the
clever American artist.&nbsp; Again, Whistler could no more have
obtained the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek, nor have written
<i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>, and <i>The Soul of
Man</i>, than Wilde, even if equipped as a painter, could have
evinced that superb restraint characterising the portraits of
&lsquo;Miss Alexander,&rsquo; &lsquo;Carlyle,&rsquo; and other
masterpieces.&nbsp; Wilde, though it is not generally known, was
something of a draughtsman in his youth.</p>
<p><i>Poems in Prose</i> were to have been continued.&nbsp; They
are the kind of stories which Wilde would tell at a dinner-table,
being invented on the spur of the moment, or inspired by the
chance observation of some one who managed to get the traditional
word in edgeways; or they were <a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>developed from some phrase in a book
Wilde might have read during the day.&nbsp; To those who remember
hearing them from his lips there must always be a feeling of
disappointment on reading them.&nbsp; He overloaded their
ornament when he came to transcribe them, and some of his friends
did not hesitate to make that criticism to him personally.&nbsp;
Though he affected annoyance, I do not think it prevented him
from writing the others, which unfortunately exist only in the
memories of friends.&nbsp; Miss Aim&eacute;e Lowther, however,
has cleverly noted down some of them in a privately printed
volume.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE RISE
OF HISTORICAL CRITICISM</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">This Essay was written for the
Chancellor&rsquo;s English Essay Prize at Oxford in 1879, the
subject being &lsquo;Historical Criticism among the
Ancients.&rsquo;&nbsp; The prize was not awarded.&nbsp; To
Professor J. W. Mackail thanks are due for revising the
proofs.</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Historical</span> criticism nowhere occurs
as an isolated fact in the civilisation or literature of any
people.&nbsp; It is part of that complex working towards freedom
which may be described as the revolt against authority.&nbsp; It
is merely one facet of that speculative spirit of an innovation,
which in the sphere of action produces democracy and revolution,
and in that of thought is the parent of philosophy and physical
science; and its importance as a factor of progress is based not
so much on the results it attains, as on the tone of thought
which it represents, and the method by which it works.</p>
<p>Being thus the resultant of forces essentially revolutionary,
it is not to be found in the ancient world among the material
despotisms of Asia or the stationary civilisation of Egypt.&nbsp;
The clay cylinders of Assyria and Babylon, the hieroglyphics of
the pyramids, form not history but the material for history.</p>
<p>The Chinese annals, ascending as they do to the barbarous
forest life of the nation, are marked with a soberness of
judgment, a freedom from invention, which is almost unparalleled
in the writings of any people; but the protective spirit which is
the characteristic of that people proved as fatal to their
literature as to their commerce.&nbsp; Free criticism is as
unknown as free trade.&nbsp; While as regards the Hindus, their
acute, analytical and logical mind is directed rather to grammar,
criticism and philosophy than to history or chronology.&nbsp;
Indeed, in history their imagination seems to have run wild,
legend and fact are so indissolubly mingled together that any
attempt to separate them seems vain.&nbsp; If we except the
identification of the Greek Sandracottus with the Indian
Chandragupta, we have really no clue by which we can test the
truth of their writings or examine their method of
investigation.</p>
<p>It is among the Hellenic branch of the Indo-Germanic race that
history proper is to be found, as well as the spirit of
historical criticism; among that wonderful offshoot of the
primitive Aryans, whom we call by the name of Greeks and to whom,
as has been well said, we owe all that moves in the world except
the blind forces of nature.</p>
<p>For, from the day when they left the chill table-lands of
Tibet and journeyed, a nomad people, to &AElig;gean shores, the
characteristic of their nature has been the search for light, and
the spirit of historical criticism is part of that wonderful
Aufkl&auml;rung or illumination of the intellect which seems to
have burst on the Greek race like a great flood of light about
the sixth century <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span></p>
<p><i>L&rsquo;esprit d&rsquo;un si&egrave;cle ne na&icirc;t pas
et ne meurt pas &agrave; jour fixe</i>, and the first critic is
perhaps as difficult to discover as the first man.&nbsp; It is
from democracy that the spirit of criticism borrows its
intolerance of dogmatic authority, from physical science the
alluring analogies of law and order, from philosophy the
conception of an essential unity underlying the complex
manifestations of phenomena.&nbsp; It appears first rather as a
changed attitude of mind than as a principle of research, and its
earliest influences are to be found in the sacred writings.</p>
<p>For men begin to doubt in questions of religion first, and
then in matters of more secular interest; and as regards the
nature of the spirit of historical criticism itself in its
ultimate development, it is not confined merely to the empirical
method of ascertaining whether an event happened or not, but is
concerned also with the investigation into the causes of events,
the general relations which phenomena of life hold to one
another, and in its ultimate development passes into the wider
question of the philosophy of history.</p>
<p>Now, while the workings of historical criticism in these two
spheres of sacred and uninspired history are essentially
manifestations of the same spirit, yet their methods are so
different, the canons of evidence so entirely separate, and the
motives in each case so unconnected, that it will be necessary
for a clear estimation of the progress of Greek thought, that we
should consider these two questions entirely apart from one
another.&nbsp; I shall then in both cases take the succession of
writers in their chronological order as representing the rational
order&mdash;not that the succession of time is always the
succession of ideas, or that dialectics moves ever in the
straight line in which Hegel conceives its advance.&nbsp; In
Greek thought, as elsewhere, there are periods of stagnation and
apparent retrogression, yet their intellectual development, not
merely in the question of historical criticism, but in their art,
their poetry and their philosophy, seems so essentially normal,
so free from all disturbing external influences, so peculiarly
rational, that in following in the footsteps of time we shall
really be progressing in the order sanctioned by reason.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> an early period in their
intellectual development the Greeks reached that critical point
in the history of every civilised nation, when speculative
invades the domain of revealed truth, when the spiritual ideas of
the people can no longer be satisfied by the lower, material
conceptions of their inspired writers, and when men find it
impossible to pour the new wine of free thought into the old
bottles of a narrow and a trammelling creed.</p>
<p>From their Aryan ancestors they had received the fatal legacy
of a mythology stained with immoral and monstrous stories which
strove to hide the rational order of nature in a chaos of
miracles, and to mar by imputed wickedness the perfection of
God&rsquo;s nature&mdash;a very shirt of Nessos in which the
Heracles of rationalism barely escaped annihilation.&nbsp; Now
while undoubtedly the speculations of Thales, and the alluring
analogies of law and order afforded by physical science, were
most important forces in encouraging the rise of the spirit of
scepticism, yet it was on its ethical side that the Greek
mythology was chiefly open to attack.</p>
<p>It is difficult to shake the popular belief in miracles, but
no man will admit sin and immorality as attributes of the Ideal
he worships; so the first symptoms of a new order of thought are
shown in the passionate outcries of Xenophanes and Heraclitos
against the evil things said by Homer of the sons of God; and in
the story told of Pythagoras, how that he saw tortured in Hell
the &lsquo;two founders of Greek theology,&rsquo; we can
recognise the rise of the Aufkl&auml;rung as clearly as we see
the Reformation foreshadowed in the <i>Inferno</i> of Dante.</p>
<p>Any honest belief, then, in the plain truth of these stories
soon succumbed before the destructive effects of the <i>a
priori</i> ethical criticism of this school; but the orthodox
party, as is its custom, found immediately a convenient shelter
under the &aelig;gis of the doctrine of metaphors and concealed
meanings.</p>
<p>To this allegorical school the tale of the fight around the
walls of Troy was a mystery, behind which, as behind a veil, were
hidden certain moral and physical truths.&nbsp; The contest
between Athena and Ares was that eternal contest between rational
thought and the brute force of ignorance; the arrows which
rattled in the quiver of the &lsquo;Far Darter&rsquo; were no
longer the instruments of vengeance shot from the golden bow of
the child of God, but the common rays of the sun, which was
itself nothing but a mere inert mass of burning metal.</p>
<p>Modern investigation, with the ruthlessness of Philistine
analysis, has ultimately brought Helen of Troy down to a symbol
of the dawn.&nbsp; There were Philistines among the Greeks also
who saw in the <i>&#7940;&nu;&alpha;&xi;
&#7936;&delta;&rho;&#8182;&nu;</i> a mere metaphor for
atmospheric power.</p>
<p>Now while this tendency to look for metaphors and hidden
meanings must be ranked as one of the germs of historical
criticism, yet it was essentially unscientific.&nbsp; Its
inherent weakness is clearly pointed out by Plato, who showed
that while this theory will no doubt explain many of the current
legends, yet, if it is to be appealed to at all, it must be as a
universal principle; a position he is by no means prepared to
admit.</p>
<p>Like many other great principles it suffered from its
disciples, and furnished its own refutation when the web of
Penelope was analysed into a metaphor of the rules of formal
logic, the warp representing the premises, and the woof the
conclusion.</p>
<p>Rejecting, then, the allegorical interpretation of the sacred
writings as an essentially dangerous method, proving either too
much or too little, Plato himself returns to the earlier mode of
attack, and re-writes history with a didactic purpose, laying
down certain ethical canons of historical criticism.&nbsp; God is
good; God is just; God is true; God is without the common
passions of men.&nbsp; These are the tests to which we are to
bring the stories of the Greek religion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God predestines no men to ruin, nor sends destruction
on innocent cities; He never walks the earth in strange disguise,
nor has to mourn for the death of any well-beloved son.&nbsp;
Away with the tears for Sarpedon, the lying dream sent to
Agamemnon, and the story of the broken covenant!&rsquo;&nbsp;
(Plato, <i>Republic</i>, Book ii. 380; iii. 388, 391.)</p>
<p>Similar ethical canons are applied to the accounts of the
heroes of the days of old, and by the same <i>a priori</i>
principles Achilles is rescued from the charges of avarice and
insolence in a passage which may be recited as the earliest
instance of that &lsquo;whitewashing of great men,&rsquo; as it
has been called, which is so popular in our own day, when
Catiline and Clodius are represented as honest and far-seeing
politicians, when <i>eine edle und gute Natur</i> is claimed for
Tiberius, and Nero is rescued from his heritage of infamy as an
accomplished <i>dilettante</i> whose moral aberrations are more
than excused by his exquisite artistic sense and charming tenor
voice.</p>
<p>But besides the allegorising principle of interpretation, and
the ethical reconstruction of history, there was a third theory,
which may be called the semi-historical, and which goes by the
name of Euhemeros, though he was by no means the first to
propound it.</p>
<p>Appealing to a fictitious monument which he declared that he
had discovered in the island of Panchaia, and which purported to
be a column erected by Zeus, and detailing the incidents of his
reign on earth, this shallow thinker attempted to show that the
gods and heroes of ancient Greece were &lsquo;mere ordinary
mortals, whose achievements had been a good deal exaggerated and
misrepresented,&rsquo; and that the proper canon of historical
criticism as regards the treatment of myths was to rationalise
the incredible, and to present the plausible residuum as actual
truth.</p>
<p>To him and his school, the centaurs, for instance, those
mythical sons of the storm, strange links between the lives of
men and animals, were merely some youths from the village of
Nephele in Thessaly, distinguished for their sporting tastes; the
&lsquo;living harvest of panoplied knights,&rsquo; which sprang
so mystically from the dragon&rsquo;s teeth, a body of mercenary
troops supported by the profits on a successful speculation in
ivory; and Act&aelig;on, an ordinary master of hounds, who,
living before the days of subscription, was eaten out of house
and home by the expenses of his kennel.</p>
<p>Now, that under the glamour of myth and legend some substratum
of historical fact may lie, is a proposition rendered extremely
probable by the modern investigations into the workings of the
mythop&oelig;ic spirit in post-Christian times.&nbsp; Charlemagne
and Roland, St. Francis and William Tell, are none the less real
personages because their histories are filled with much that is
fictitious and incredible, but in all cases what is essentially
necessary is some external corroboration, such as is afforded by
the mention of Roland and Roncesvalles in the chronicles of
England, or (in the sphere of Greek legend) by the excavations of
Hissarlik.&nbsp; But to rob a mythical narrative of its kernel of
supernatural elements, and to present the dry husk thus obtained
as historical fact, is, as has been well said, to mistake
entirely the true method of investigation and to identify
plausibility with truth.</p>
<p>And as regards the critical point urged by Palaiphatos,
Strabo, and Polybius, that pure invention on Homer&rsquo;s part
is inconceivable, we may without scruple allow it, for myths,
like constitutions, grow gradually, and are not formed in a
day.&nbsp; But between a poet&rsquo;s deliberate creation and
historical accuracy there is a wide field of the mythop&oelig;ic
faculty.</p>
<p>This Euhemeristic theory was welcomed as an essentially
philosophical and critical method by the unscientific Romans, to
whom it was introduced by the poet Ennius, that pioneer of
cosmopolitan Hellenicism, and it continued to characterise the
tone of ancient thought on the question of the treatment of
mythology till the rise of Christianity, when it was turned by
such writers as Augustine and Minucius Felix into a formidable
weapon of attack on Paganism.&nbsp; It was then abandoned by all
those who still bent the knee to Athena or to Zeus, and a general
return, aided by the philosophic mystics of Alexandria, to the
allegorising principle of interpretation took place, as the only
means of saving the deities of Olympus from the Titan assaults of
the new Galilean God.&nbsp; In what vain defence, the statue of
Mary set in the heart of the Pantheon can best tell us.</p>
<p>Religions, however, may be absorbed, but they never are
disproved, and the stories of the Greek mythology, spiritualised
by the purifying influence of Christianity, reappear in many of
the southern parts of Europe in our own day.&nbsp; The old fable
that the Greek gods took service with the new religion under
assumed names has more truth in it than the many care to
discover.</p>
<p>Having now traced the progress of historical criticism in the
special treatment of myth and legend, I shall proceed to
investigate the form in which the same spirit manifested itself
as regards what one may term secular history and secular
historians.&nbsp; The field traversed will be found to be in some
respects the same, but the mental attitude, the spirit, the
motive of investigation are all changed.</p>
<p>There were heroes before the son of Atreus and historians
before Herodotus, yet the latter is rightly hailed as the father
of history, for in him we discover not merely the empirical
connection of cause and effect, but that constant reference to
Laws, which is the characteristic of the historian proper.</p>
<p>For all history must be essentially universal; not in the
sense of comprising all the synchronous events of the past time,
but through the universality of the principles employed.&nbsp;
And the great conceptions which unify the work of Herodotus are
such as even modern thought has not yet rejected.&nbsp; The
immediate government of the world by God, the nemesis and
punishment which sin and pride invariably bring with them, the
revealing of God&rsquo;s purpose to His people by signs and
omens, by miracles and by prophecy; these are to Herodotus the
laws which govern the phenomena of history.&nbsp; He is
essentially the type of supernatural historian; his eyes are ever
strained to discern the Spirit of God moving over the face of the
waters of life; he is more concerned with final than with
efficient causes.</p>
<p>Yet we can discern in him the rise of that <i>historic
sense</i> which is the rational antecedent of the science of
historical criticism, the
<i>&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&#8056;&nu;
&kappa;&rho;&iota;&tau;&#942;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</i>, to use
the words of a Greek writer, as opposed to that which comes
either <i>&tau;&#941;&chi;&nu;&eta;</i> or
<i>&delta;&iota;&delta;&alpha;&chi;&#8135;</i>.</p>
<p>He has passed through the valley of faith and has caught a
glimpse of the sunlit heights of Reason; but like all those who,
while accepting the supernatural, yet attempt to apply the canons
of rationalism, he is essentially inconsistent.&nbsp; For the
better apprehension of the character of this historic sense in
Herodotus it will be necessary to examine at some length the
various forms of criticism in which it manifests itself.</p>
<p>Such fabulous stories as that of the Phoenix, of the
goat-footed men, of the headless beings with eyes in their
breasts, of the men who slept six months in the year
(<i>&tau;&omicron;&#8166;&tau;&omicron; &omicron;&#8016;&kappa;
&#7952;&nu;&delta;&#941;&chi;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&iota;
&eta;&#8052;&nu; &#7936;&rho;&chi;&#942;&nu;</i>), of the
wer-wolf of the Neuri, and the like, are entirely rejected by him
as being opposed to the ordinary experience of life, and to those
natural laws whose universal influence the early Greek physical
philosophers had already made known to the world of
thought.&nbsp; Other legends, such as the suckling of Cyrus by a
bitch, or the feather-rain of northern Europe, are rationalised
and explained into a woman&rsquo;s name and a fall of snow.&nbsp;
The supernatural origin of the Scythian nation, from the union of
Hercules and the monstrous Echidna, is set aside by him for the
more probable account that they were a nomad tribe driven by the
Massaget&aelig; from Asia; and he appeals to the local names of
their country as proof of the fact that the Kimmerians were the
original possessors.</p>
<p>But in the case of Herodotus it will be more instructive to
pass on from points like these to those questions of general
probability, the true apprehension of which depends rather on a
certain quality of mind than on any possibility of formulated
rules, questions which form no unimportant part of scientific
history; for it must be remembered always that the canons of
historical criticism are essentially different from those of
judicial evidence, for they cannot, like the latter, be made
plain to every ordinary mind, but appeal to a certain historical
faculty founded on the experience of life.&nbsp; Besides, the
rules for the reception of evidence in courts of law are purely
stationary, while the science of historical probability is
essentially progressive, and changes with the advancing spirit of
each age.</p>
<p>Now, of all the speculative canons of historical criticism,
none is more important than that which rests on psychological
probability.</p>
<p>Arguing from his knowledge of human nature, Herodotus rejects
the presence of Helen within the walls of Troy.&nbsp; Had she
been there, he says, Priam and his kinsmen would never have been
so mad
(<i>&phi;&rho;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&beta;&lambda;&alpha;&beta;&epsilon;&#8150;&sigmaf;</i>)
as not to give her up, when they and their children and their
city were in such peril (ii. 118); and as regards the authority
of Homer, some incidental passages in his poem show that he knew
of Helen&rsquo;s sojourn in Egypt during the siege, but selected
the other story as being a more suitable motive for an
epic.&nbsp; Similarly he does not believe that the
Alcm&aelig;onid&aelig; family, a family who had always been the
haters of tyranny
(<i>&mu;&iota;&sigma;&omicron;&tau;&#973;&rho;&alpha;&nu;&nu;&omicron;&iota;</i>),
and to whom, even more than to Harmodios and Aristogeiton, Athens
owed its liberty, would ever have been so treacherous as to hold
up a shield after the battle of Marathon as a signal for the
Persian host to fall on the city.&nbsp; A shield, he
acknowledges, was held up, but it could not possibly have been
done by such friends of liberty as the house of Alcm&aelig;on;
nor will he believe that a great king like Rhampsinitus would
have sent his daughter
<i>&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#943;&sigma;&alpha;&iota;
&#7952;&pi;&rsquo;
&omicron;&#7984;&kappa;&#942;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere he argues from more general considerations of
probability; a Greek courtesan like Rhodopis would hardly have
been rich enough to build a pyramid, and, besides, on
chronological grounds the story is impossible (ii. 134).</p>
<p>In another passage (ii. 63), after giving an account of the
forcible entry of the priests of Ares into the chapel of the
god&rsquo;s mother, which seems to have been a sort of religious
faction fight where sticks were freely used
(<i>&mu;&#940;&chi;&eta;
&xi;&#973;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;&sigma;&iota;
&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&#942;</i>), &lsquo;I feel
sure,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;that many of them died from getting
their heads broken, notwithstanding the assertions of the
Egyptian priests to the contrary.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is also
something charmingly na&iuml;ve in the account he gives of the
celebrated Greek swimmer who dived a distance of eighty stadia to
give his countrymen warning of the Persian advance.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If, however,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I may offer an opinion
on the subject, I would say that he came in a boat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is, of course, something a little trivial in some of the
instances I have quoted; but in a writer like Herodotus, who
stands on the borderland between faith and rationalism, one likes
to note even the most minute instances of the rise of the
critical and sceptical spirit of inquiry.</p>
<p>How really strange, at base, it was with him may, I think, be
shown by a reference to those passages where he applies
rationalistic tests to matters connected with religion.&nbsp; He
nowhere, indeed, grapples with the moral and scientific
difficulties of the Greek Bible; and where he rejects as
incredible the marvellous achievements of Hercules in Egypt, he
does so on the express grounds that he had not yet been received
among the gods, and so was still subject to the ordinary
conditions of mortal life (<i>&#7956;&tau;&iota;
&#7940;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&nu;
&#7952;&#972;&nu;&tau;&alpha;</i>).</p>
<p>Even within these limits, however, his religious conscience
seems to have been troubled at such daring rationalism, and the
passage (ii. 45) concludes with a pious hope that God will pardon
him for having gone so far, the great rationalistic passage
being, of course, that in which he rejects the mythical account
of the foundation of Dodona.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can a dove speak
with a human voice?&rsquo; he asks, and rationalises the bird
into a foreign princess.</p>
<p>Similarly he seems more inclined to believe that the great
storm at the beginning of the Persian War ceased from ordinary
atmospheric causes, and not in consequence of the incantations of
the <i>Magians</i>.&nbsp; He calls Melampos, whom the majority of
the Greeks looked on as an inspired prophet, &lsquo;a clever man
who had acquired for himself the art of prophecy&rsquo;; and as
regards the miracle told of the &AElig;ginetan statues of the
primeval deities of Damia and Auxesia, that they fell on their
knees when the sacrilegious Athenians strove to carry them off,
&lsquo;any one may believe it,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;who likes,
but as for myself, I place no credence in the tale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So much then for the rationalistic spirit of historical
criticism, as far as it appears explicitly in the works of this
great and philosophic writer; but for an adequate appreciation of
his position we must also note how conscious he was of the value
of documentary evidence, of the use of inscriptions, of the
importance of the poets as throwing light on manners and customs
as well as on historical incidents.&nbsp; No writer of any age
has more vividly recognised the fact that history is a matter of
evidence, and that it is as necessary for the historian to state
his authority as it is to produce one&rsquo;s witnesses in a
court of law.</p>
<p>While, however, we can discern in Herodotus the rise of an
historic sense, we must not blind ourselves to the large amount
of instances where he receives supernatural influences as part of
the ordinary forces of life.&nbsp; Compared to Thucydides, who
succeeded him in the development of history, he appears almost
like a medi&aelig;val writer matched with a modern
rationalist.&nbsp; For, contemporary though they were, between
these two authors there is an infinite chasm of thought.</p>
<p>The essential difference of their methods may be best
illustrated from those passages where they treat of the same
subject.&nbsp; The execution of the Spartan heralds, Nicolaos and
Aneristos, during the Peloponnesian War is regarded by Herodotus
as one of the most supernatural instances of the workings of
nemesis and the wrath of an outraged hero; while the lengthened
siege and ultimate fall of Troy was brought about by the avenging
hand of God desiring to manifest unto men the mighty penalties
which always follow upon mighty sins.&nbsp; But Thucydides either
sees not, or desires not to see, in either of these events the
finger of Providence, or the punishment of wicked doers.&nbsp;
The death of the heralds is merely an Athenian retaliation for
similar outrages committed by the opposite side; the long agony
of the ten years&rsquo; siege is due merely to the want of a good
commissariat in the Greek army; while the fall of the city is the
result of a united military attack consequent on a good supply of
provisions.</p>
<p>Now, it is to be observed that in this latter passage, as well
as elsewhere, Thucydides is in no sense of the word a sceptic as
regards his attitude towards the truth of these ancient
legends.</p>
<p>Agamemnon and Atreus, Theseus and Eurystheus, even Minos,
about whom Herodotus has some doubts, are to him as real
personages as Alcibiades or Gylippus.&nbsp; The points in his
historical criticism of the past are, first, his rejection of all
extra-natural interference, and, secondly, the attributing to
these ancient heroes the motives and modes of thought of his own
day.&nbsp; The present was to him the key to the explanation of
the past, as it was to the prediction of the future.</p>
<p>Now, as regards his attitude towards the supernatural he is at
one with modern science.&nbsp; We too know that, just as the
primeval coal-beds reveal to us the traces of rain-drops and
other atmospheric phenomena similar to those of our own day, so,
in estimating the history of the past, the introduction of no
force must be allowed whose workings we cannot observe among the
phenomena around us.&nbsp; To lay down canons of ultra-historical
credibility for the explanation of events which happen to have
preceded us by a few thousand years, is as thoroughly
unscientific as it is to intermingle preternatural in geological
theories.</p>
<p>Whatever the canons of art may be, no difficulty in history is
so great as to warrant the introduction of a spirit of spirit
<i>&theta;&epsilon;&#8056;&sigmaf; &#7936;&pi;&#8056;
&mu;&eta;&chi;&alpha;&nu;&#8134;&sigmaf;</i>, in the sense of a
violation of the laws of nature.</p>
<p>Upon the other point, however, Thucydides falls into an
anachronism.&nbsp; To refuse to allow the workings of chivalrous
and self-denying motives among the knights of the Trojan crusade,
because he saw none in the faction-loving Athenian of his own
day, is to show an entire ignorance of the various
characteristics of human nature developing under different
circumstances, and to deny to a primitive chieftain like
Agamemnon that authority founded on opinion, to which we give the
name of divine right, is to fall into an historical error quite
as gross as attributing to Atreus the courting of the populace
(<i>&tau;&epsilon;&theta;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&pi;&epsilon;&upsilon;&kappa;&#972;&tau;&alpha;
&tau;&#8056;&nu; &delta;&#8134;&mu;&omicron;&nu;</i>) with a view
to the Mycenean throne.</p>
<p>The general method of historical criticism pursued by
Thucydides having been thus indicated, it remains to proceed more
into detail as regards those particular points where he claims
for himself a more rational method of estimating evidence than
either the public or his predecessors possessed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So little pains,&rsquo; he remarks, &lsquo;do the
vulgar take in the investigation of truth, satisfied with their
preconceived opinions,&rsquo; that the majority of the Greeks
believe in a Pitanate cohort of the Spartan army and in a double
vote being the prerogative of the Spartan kings, neither of which
opinions has any foundation in fact.&nbsp; But the chief point on
which he lays stress as evincing the &lsquo;uncritical way with
which men receive legends, even the legends of their own
country,&rsquo; is the entire baselessness of the common Athenian
tradition in which Harmodios and Aristogeiton were represented as
the patriotic liberators of Athens from the Peisistratid
tyranny.&nbsp; So far, he points out, from the love of freedom
being their motive, both of them were influenced by merely
personal considerations, Aristogeiton being jealous of
Hipparchos&rsquo; attention to Harmodios, then a beautiful boy in
the flower of Greek loveliness, while the latter&rsquo;s
indignation was aroused by an insult offered to his sister by the
prince.</p>
<p>Their motives, then, were personal revenge, while the result
of their conspiracy served only to rivet more tightly the chains
of servitude which bound Athens to the Peisistratid house, for
Hipparchos, whom they killed, was only the tyrant&rsquo;s younger
brother, and not the tyrant himself.</p>
<p>To prove his theory that Hippias was the elder, he appeals to
the evidence afforded by a public inscription in which his name
occurs immediately after that of his father, a point which he
thinks shows that he was the eldest, and so the heir.&nbsp; This
view he further corroborates by another inscription, on the altar
of Apollo, which mentions the children of Hippias and not those
of his brothers; &lsquo;for it was natural for the eldest to be
married first&rsquo;; and besides this, on the score of general
probability he points out that, had Hippias been the younger, he
would not have so easily obtained the tyranny on the death of
Hipparchos.</p>
<p>Now, what is important in Thucydides, as evinced in the
treatment of legend generally, is not the results he arrived at,
but the method by which he works.&nbsp; The first great
rationalistic historian, he may be said to have paved the way for
all those who followed after him, though it must always be
remembered that, while the total absence in his pages of all the
mystical paraphernalia of the supernatural theory of life is an
advance in the progress of rationalism, and an era in scientific
history, whose importance could never be over-estimated, yet we
find along with it a total absence of any mention of those
various social and economical forces which form such important
factors in the evolution of the world, and to which Herodotus
rightly gave great prominence in his immortal work.&nbsp; The
history of Thucydides is essentially one-sided and
incomplete.&nbsp; The intricate details of sieges and battles,
subjects with which the historian proper has really nothing to do
except so far as they may throw light on the spirit of the age,
we would readily exchange for some notice of the condition of
private society in Athens, or the influence and position of
women.</p>
<p>There is an advance in the method of historical criticism;
there is an advance in the conception and motive of history
itself; for in Thucydides we may discern that natural reaction
against the intrusion of didactic and theological considerations
into the sphere of the pure intellect, the spirit of which may be
found in the Euripidean treatment of tragedy and the later
schools of art, as well as in the Platonic conception of
science.</p>
<p>History, no doubt, has splendid lessons for our instruction,
just as all good art comes to us as the herald of the noblest
truth.&nbsp; But, to set before either the painter or the
historian the inculcation of moral lessons as an aim to be
consciously pursued, is to miss entirely the true motive and
characteristic both of art and history, which is in the one case
the creation of beauty, in the other the discovery of the laws of
the evolution of progress: <i>Il ne faut demander de l&rsquo;Art
que l&rsquo;Art</i>, <i>du pass&eacute; que le
pass&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>Herodotus wrote to illustrate the wonderful ways of Providence
and the nemesis that falls on sin, and his work is a good example
of the truth that nothing can dispense with criticism so much as
a moral aim.&nbsp; Thucydides has no creed to preach, no doctrine
to prove.&nbsp; He analyses the results which follow inevitably
from certain antecedents, in order that on a recurrence of the
same crisis men may know how to act.</p>
<p>His object was to discover the laws of the past so as to serve
as a light to illumine the future.&nbsp; We must not confuse the
recognition of the utility of history with any ideas of a
didactic aim.&nbsp; Two points more in Thucydides remain for our
consideration: his treatment of the rise of Greek civilisation,
and of the primitive condition of Hellas, as well as the question
how far can he be said really to have recognised the existence of
laws regulating the complex phenomena of life.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> investigation into the two
great problems of the origin of society and the philosophy of
history occupies such an important position in the evolution of
Greek thought that, to obtain any clear view of the workings of
the critical spirit, it will be necessary to trace at some length
their rise and scientific development as evinced not merely in
the works of historians proper, but also in the philosophical
treatises of Plato and Aristotle.&nbsp; The important position
which these two great thinkers occupy in the progress of
historical criticism can hardly be over-estimated.&nbsp; I do not
mean merely as regards their treatment of the Greek Bible, and
Plato&rsquo;s endeavours to purge sacred history of its
immorality by the application of ethical canons at the time when
Aristotle was beginning to undermine the basis of miracles by his
scientific conception of law, but with reference to these two
wider questions of the rise of civil institutions and the
philosophy of history.</p>
<p>And first, as regards the current theories of the primitive
condition of society, there was a wide divergence of opinion in
Hellenic society, just as there is now.&nbsp; For while the
majority of the orthodox public, of whom Hesiod may be taken as
the representative, looked back, as a great many of our own day
still do, to a fabulous age of innocent happiness, a
<i>bell&rsquo; et&agrave; dell&rsquo; auro</i>, where sin and
death were unknown and men and women were like Gods, the foremost
men of intellect such as Aristotle and Plato, &AElig;schylus and
many of the other poets <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a> saw in primitive man
&lsquo;a few small sparks of humanity preserved on the tops of
mountains after some deluge,&rsquo; &lsquo;without an idea of
cities, governments or legislation,&rsquo; &lsquo;living the
lives of wild beasts in sunless caves,&rsquo; &lsquo;their only
law being the survival of the fittest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And this, too, was the opinion of Thucydides, whose
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i> as it is contains a most valuable
disquisition on the early condition of Hellas, which it will be
necessary to examine at some length.</p>
<p>Now, as regards the means employed generally by Thucydides for
the elucidation of ancient history, I have already pointed out
how that, while acknowledging that &lsquo;it is the tendency of
every poet to exaggerate, as it is of every chronicler to seek to
be attractive at the expense of truth,&rsquo; he yet assumes in
the thoroughly euhemeristic way, that under the veil of myth and
legend there does yet exist a rational basis of fact discoverable
by the method of rejecting all supernatural interference as well
as any extraordinary motives influencing the actors.&nbsp; It is
in complete accordance with this spirit that he appeals, for
instance, to the Homeric epithet of
<i>&#7936;&phi;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&#972;&sigmaf;</i>, as applied
to Corinth, as a proof of the early commercial prosperity of that
city; to the fact of the generic name <i>Hellenes</i> not
occurring in the <i>Iliad</i> as a corroboration of his theory of
the essentially disunited character of the primitive Greek
tribes; and he argues from the line &lsquo;O&rsquo;er many
islands and all Argos ruled,&rsquo; as applied to Agamemnon, that
his forces must have been partially naval, &lsquo;for
Agamemnon&rsquo;s was a continental power, and he could not have
been master of any but the adjacent islands, and these would not
be many but through the possession of a fleet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anticipating in some measure the comparative method of
research, he argues from the fact of the more barbarous Greek
tribes, such as the &AElig;tolians and Acarnanians, still
carrying arms in his own day, that this custom was the case
originally over the whole country.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fact,&rsquo;
he says, &lsquo;that the people in these parts of Hellas are
still living in the old way points to a time when the same mode
of life was equally common to all.&rsquo;&nbsp; Similarly, in
another passage, he shows how a corroboration of his theory of
the respectable character of piracy in ancient days is afforded
by &lsquo;the honour with which some of the inhabitants of the
continent still regard a successful marauder,&rsquo; as well as
by the fact that the question, &lsquo;Are you a pirate?&rsquo; is
a common feature of primitive society as shown in the poets; and
finally, after observing how the old Greek custom of wearing
belts in gymnastic contests still survived among the more
uncivilised Asiatic tribes, he observes that there are many other
points in which a likeness may be shown between the life of the
primitive Hellenes and that of the barbarians to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As regards the evidence afforded by ancient remains, while
adducing as a proof of the insecure character of early Greek
society the fact of their cities <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a> being always built
at some distance from the sea, yet he is careful to warn us, and
the caution ought to be borne in mind by all arch&aelig;ologists,
that we have no right to conclude from the scanty remains of any
city that its legendary greatness in primitive times was a mere
exaggeration.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are not justified,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;in rejecting the tradition of the magnitude of the Trojan
armament, because Mycen&aelig; and the other towns of that age
seem to us small and insignificant.&nbsp; For, if Laced&aelig;mon
was to become desolate, any antiquarian judging merely from its
ruins would be inclined to regard the tale of the Spartan
hegemony as an idle myth; for the city is a mere collection of
villages after the old fashion of Hellas, and has none of those
splendid public buildings and temples which characterise Athens,
and whose remains, in the case of the latter city, would be so
marvellous as to lead the superficial observer into an
exaggerated estimate of the Athenian power.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing
can be more scientific than the arch&aelig;ological canons laid
down, whose truth is strikingly illustrated to any one who has
compared the waste fields of the Eurotas plain with the lordly
monuments of the Athenian acropolis. <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Thucydides is quite conscious of the value
of the positive evidence afforded by arch&aelig;ological
remains.&nbsp; He appeals, for instance, to the character of the
armour found in the Delian tombs and the peculiar mode of
sepulture, as corroboration of his theory of the predominance of
the Carian element among the primitive islanders, and to the
concentration of all the temples either in the Acropolis, or in
its immediate vicinity, to the name of
<i>&#7940;&sigma;&tau;&upsilon;</i> by which it was still known,
and to the extraordinary sanctity of the spring of water there,
as proof that the primitive city was originally confined to the
citadel, and the district immediately beneath it (ii. 16).&nbsp;
And lastly, in the very opening of his history, anticipating one
of the most scientific of modern methods, he points out how in
early states of civilisation immense fertility of the soil tends
to favour the personal aggrandisement of individuals, and so to
stop the normal progress of the country through &lsquo;the rise
of factions, that endless source of ruin&rsquo;; and also by the
allurements it offers to a foreign invader, to necessitate a
continual change of population, one immigration following on
another.&nbsp; He exemplifies his theory by pointing to the
endless political revolutions that characterised Arcadia,
Thessaly and Boeotia, the three richest spots in Greece, as well
as by the negative instance of the undisturbed state in primitive
time of Attica, which was always remarkable for the dryness and
poverty of its soil.</p>
<p>Now, while undoubtedly in these passages we may recognise the
first anticipation of many of the most modern principles of
research, we must remember how essentially limited is the range
of the <i>arch&aelig;ologia</i>, and how no theory at all is
offered on the wider questions of the general conditions of the
rise and progress of humanity, a problem which is first
scientifically discussed in the <i>Republic</i> of Plato.</p>
<p>And at the outset it must be premised that, while the study of
primitive man is an essentially inductive science, resting rather
on the accumulation of evidence than on speculation, among the
Greeks it was prosecuted rather on deductive principles.&nbsp;
Thucydides did, indeed, avail himself of the opportunities
afforded by the unequal development of civilisation in his own
day in Greece, and in the places I have pointed out seems to have
anticipated the comparative method.&nbsp; But we do not find
later writers availing themselves of the wonderfully accurate and
picturesque accounts given by Herodotus of the customs of savage
tribes.&nbsp; To take one instance, which bears a good deal on
modern questions, we find in the works of this great traveller
the gradual and progressive steps in the development of the
family life clearly manifested in the mere gregarious herding
together of the Agathyrsi, their primitive kinsmanship through
women in common, and the rise of a feeling of paternity from a
state of polyandry.&nbsp; This tribe stood at that time on that
borderland between umbilical relationship and the family which
has been such a difficult point for modern anthropologists to
find.</p>
<p>The ancient authors, however, are unanimous in insisting that
the family is the ultimate unit of society, though, as I have
said, an inductive study of primitive races, or even the accounts
given of them by Herodotus, would have shown them that the
<i>&nu;&epsilon;&omicron;&tau;&tau;&iota;&#8048;
&#7988;&delta;&iota;&alpha;</i> of a personal household, to use
Plato&rsquo;s expression, is really a most complex notion
appearing always in a late stage of civilisation, along with
recognition of private property and the rights of
individualism.</p>
<p>Philology also, which in the hands of modern investigators has
proved such a splendid instrument of research, was in ancient
days studied on principles too unscientific to be of much
use.&nbsp; Herodotus points out that the word <i>Eridanos</i> is
essentially Greek in character, that consequently the river
supposed to run round the world is probably a mere Greek
invention.&nbsp; His remarks, however, on language generally, as
in the case of <i>Piromis</i> and the ending of the Persian
names, show on what unsound basis his knowledge of language
rested.</p>
<p>In the <i>Bacch&aelig;</i> of Euripides there is an extremely
interesting passage in which the immoral stories of the Greek
mythology are accounted for on the principle of that
misunderstanding of words and metaphors to which modern science
has given the name of a disease of language.&nbsp; In answer to
the impious rationalism of Pentheus&mdash;a sort of modern
Philistine&mdash;Teiresias, who may be termed the Max M&uuml;ller
of the Theban cycle, points out that the story of Dionysus being
inclosed in Zeus&rsquo; thigh really arose from the linguistic
confusion between <i>&mu;&eta;&rho;&#972;&sigmaf;</i> and
<i>&#8005;&mu;&eta;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i>.</p>
<p>On the whole, however&mdash;for I have quoted these two
instances only to show the unscientific character of early
philology&mdash;we may say that this important instrument in
recreating the history of the past was not really used by the
ancients as a means of historical criticism.&nbsp; Nor did the
ancients employ that other method, used to such advantage in our
own day, by which in the symbolism and formulas of an advanced
civilisation we can detect the unconscious survival of ancient
customs: for, whereas in the sham capture of the bride at a
marriage feast, which was common in Wales till a recent time, we
can discern the lingering reminiscence of the barbarous habit of
exogamy, the ancient writers saw only the deliberate
commemoration of an historical event.</p>
<p>Aristotle does not tell us by what method he discovered that
the Greeks used to buy their wives in primitive times, but,
judging by his general principles, it was probably through some
legend or myth on the subject which lasted to his own day, and
not, as we would do, by arguing back from the marriage presents
given to the bride and her relatives. <a name="citation37"></a><a
href="#footnote37" class="citation">[37]</a></p>
<p>The origin of the common proverb &lsquo;worth so many
beeves,&rsquo; in which we discern the unconscious survival of a
purely pastoral state of society before the use of metals was
known, is ascribed by Plutarch to the fact of Theseus having
coined money bearing a bull&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Similarly, the
Amathusian festival, in which a young man imitated the labours of
a woman in travail, is regarded by him as a rite instituted in
Ariadne&rsquo;s honour, and the Carian adoration of asparagus as
a simple commemoration of the adventure of the nymph
Perigune.&nbsp; In the first of these <i>we</i> discern the
beginning of agnation and kinsmanship through the father, which
still lingers in the &lsquo;couvee&rsquo; of New Zealand tribes:
while the second is a relic of the totem and fetish worship of
plants.</p>
<p>Now, in entire opposition to this modern inductive principle
of research stands the philosophic Plato, whose account of
primitive man is entirely speculative and deductive.</p>
<p>The origin of society he ascribes to necessity, the mother of
all inventions, and imagines that individual man began
deliberately to herd together on account of the advantages of the
principle of division of labour and the rendering of mutual
need.</p>
<p>It must, however, be borne in mind that Plato&rsquo;s object
in this whole passage in the <i>Republic</i> was, perhaps, not so
much to analyse the conditions of early society as to illustrate
the importance of the division of labour, the shibboleth of his
political economy, by showing what a powerful factor it must have
been in the most primitive as well as in the most complex states
of society; just as in the <i>Laws</i> he almost rewrites
entirely the history of the Peloponnesus in order to prove the
necessity of a balance of power.&nbsp; He surely, I mean, must
have recognised himself how essentially incomplete his theory was
in taking no account of the origin of family life, the position
and influence of women, and other social questions, as well as in
disregarding those deeper motives of religion, which are such
important factors in early civilisation, and whose influence
Aristotle seems to have clearly apprehended, when he says that
the aim of primitive society was not merely life but the higher
life, and that in the origin of society utility is not the sole
motive, but that there is something spiritual in it if, at least,
&lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; will bring out the meaning of that
complex expression <i>&tau;&#8056;
&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#972;&nu;</i>.&nbsp; Otherwise, the whole
account in the <i>Republic</i> of primitive man will always
remain as a warning against the intrusion of <i>a priori</i>
speculations in the domain appropriate to induction.</p>
<p>Now, Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of the origin of society, like
his philosophy of ethics, rests ultimately on the principle of
final causes, not in the theological meaning of an aim or
tendency imposed from without, but in the scientific sense of
function corresponding to organ.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nature maketh no
thing in vain&rsquo; is the text of Aristotle in this as in other
inquiries.&nbsp; Man being the only animal possessed of the power
of rational speech is, he asserts, by nature intended to be
social, more so than the bee or any other gregarious animal.</p>
<p>He is <i>&phi;&#973;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;
&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#972;&sigmaf;</i>,
and the national tendency towards higher forms of perfection
brings the &lsquo;armed savage who used to sell his wife&rsquo;
to the free independence of a free state, and to the
<i>&#7984;&sigma;&#972;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&#7940;&rho;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&#7940;&rho;&chi;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</i>, which
was the test of true citizenship.&nbsp; The stages passed through
by humanity start with the family first as the ultimate unit.</p>
<p>The conglomeration of families forms a village ruled by that
patriarchal sway which is the oldest form of government in the
world, as is shown by the fact that all men count it to be the
constitution of heaven, and the villages are merged into the
state, and here the progression stops.</p>
<p>For Aristotle, like all Greek thinkers, found his ideal within
the walls of the <i>&pi;&#972;&lambda;&iota;&sigmaf;</i>, yet
perhaps in his remark that a united Greece would rule the world
we may discern some anticipation of that &lsquo;federal union of
free states into one consolidated empire&rsquo; which, more than
the <i>&pi;&#972;&lambda;&iota;&sigmaf;</i>, is to our eyes the
ultimately perfect polity.</p>
<p>How far Aristotle was justified in regarding the family as the
ultimate unit, with the materials afforded to him by Greek
literature, I have already noticed.&nbsp; Besides, Aristotle, I
may remark, had he reflected on the meaning of that Athenian law
which, while prohibiting marriage with a uterine sister,
permitted it with a sister-german, or on the common tradition in
Athens that before the time of Cecrops children bore their
mothers&rsquo; names, or on some of the Spartan regulations,
could hardly have failed to see the universality of kinsmanship
through women in early days, and the late appearance of
monandry.&nbsp; Yet, while he missed this point, in common, it
must be acknowledged, with many modern writers, such as Sir Henry
Maine, it is essentially as an explorer of inductive instances
that we recognise his improvement on Plato.&nbsp; The treatise
<i>&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054;
&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&tau;&epsilon;&#943;&omega;&nu;</i>,
did it remain to us in its entirety, would have been one of the
most valuable landmarks in the progress of historical criticism,
and the first scientific treatise on the science of comparative
politics.</p>
<p>A few fragments still remain to us, in one of which we find
Aristotle appealing to the authority of an ancient inscription on
the &lsquo;Disk of Iphitus,&rsquo; one of the most celebrated
Greek antiquities, to corroborate his theory of the Lycurgean
revival of the Olympian festival; while his enormous research is
evinced in the elaborate explanation he gives of the historical
origin of proverbs such as
<i>&omicron;&#8016;&delta;&epsilon;&#8150;&sigmaf;
&mu;&#941;&gamma;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#8056;&sigmaf;
&#7984;&chi;&theta;&#8166;&sigmaf;</i>, of religious songs like
the <i>&#7984;&#8182;&mu;&epsilon;&nu; &#7952;&sigmaf;
&#7944;&theta;&#942;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;</i> of the Botticean
virgins, or the praises of love and war.</p>
<p>And, finally, it is to be observed how much wider than
Plato&rsquo;s his theory of the origin of society is.&nbsp; They
both rest on a psychological basis, but Aristotle&rsquo;s
recognition of the capacity for progress and the tendency towards
a higher life shows how much deeper his knowledge of human nature
was.</p>
<p>In imitation of these two philosophers, Polybius gives an
account of the origin of society in the opening to his philosophy
of history.&nbsp; Somewhat in the spirit of Plato, he imagines
that after one of the cyclic deluges which sweep off mankind at
stated periods and annihilate all pre-existing civilisation, the
few surviving members of humanity coalesce for mutual protection,
and, as in the case with ordinary animals, the one most
remarkable for physical strength is elected king.&nbsp; In a
short time, owing to the workings of sympathy and the desire of
approbation, the moral qualities begin to make their appearance,
and intellectual instead of bodily excellence becomes the
qualification for sovereignty.</p>
<p>Other points, as the rise of law and the like, are dwelt on in
a somewhat modern spirit, and although Polybius seems not to have
employed the inductive method of research in this question, or
rather, I should say, of the hierarchical order of the rational
progress of ideas in life, he is not far removed from what the
laborious investigations of modern travellers have given us.</p>
<p>And, indeed, as regards the working of the speculative faculty
in the creation of history, it is in all respects marvellous how
that the most truthful accounts of the passage from barbarism to
civilisation in ancient literature come from the works of
poets.&nbsp; The elaborate researches of Mr. Tylor and Sir John
Lubbock have done little more than verify the theories put
forward in the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> and the <i>De Natura
Rerum</i>; yet neither &AElig;schylus nor Lucretias followed in
the modern path, but rather attained to truth by a certain almost
mystic power of creative imagination, such as we now seek to
banish from science as a dangerous power, though to it science
seems to owe many of its most splendid generalities. <a
name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a></p>
<p>Leaving then the question of the origin of society as treated
by the ancients, I shall now turn to the other and the more
important question of how far they may he said to have attained
to what we call the philosophy of history.</p>
<p>Now at the outset we must note that, while the conceptions of
law and order have been universally received as the governing
principles of the phenomena of nature in the sphere of physical
science, yet their intrusion into the domain of history and the
life of man has always been met with a strong opposition, on the
ground of the incalculable nature of two great forces acting on
human action, a certain causeless spontaneity which men call free
will, and the extra-natural interference which they attribute as
a constant attribute to God.</p>
<p>Now, that there is a science of the apparently variable
phenomena of history is a conception which <i>we</i> have perhaps
only recently begun to appreciate; yet, like all other great
thoughts, it seems to have come to the Greek mind spontaneously,
through a certain splendour of imagination, in the morning tide
of their civilisation, before inductive research had armed them
with the instruments of verification.&nbsp; For I think it is
possible to discern in some of the mystic speculations of the
early Greek thinkers that desire to discover what is that
&lsquo;invariable existence of which there are variable
states,&rsquo; and to incorporate it in some one formula of law
which may serve to explain the different manifestations of all
organic bodies, <i>man included</i>, which is the germ of the
philosophy of history; the germ indeed of an idea of which it is
not too much to say that on it any kind of historical criticism,
worthy of the name, must ultimately rest.</p>
<p>For the very first requisite for any scientific conception of
history is the doctrine of uniform sequence: in other words, that
certain events having happened, certain other events
corresponding to them will happen also; that the past is the key
of the future.</p>
<p>Now at the birth of this great conception science, it is true,
presided, yet religion it was which at the outset clothed it in
its own garb, and familiarised men with it by appealing to their
hearts first and then to their intellects; knowing that at the
beginning of things it is through the moral nature, and not
through the intellectual, that great truths are spread.</p>
<p>So in Herodotus, who may be taken as a representative of the
orthodox tone of thought, the idea of the uniform sequence of
cause and effect appears under the theological aspect of Nemesis
and Providence, which is really the scientific conception of law,
only it is viewed from an <i>ethical</i> standpoint.</p>
<p>Now in Thucydides the philosophy of history rests on the
probability, which the uniformity of human nature affords us,
that the future will in the course of human things resemble the
past, if not reproduce it.&nbsp; He appears to contemplate a
recurrence of the phenomena of history as equally certain with a
return of the epidemic of the Great Plague.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding what German critics have written on the
subject, we must beware of regarding this conception as a mere
reproduction of that cyclic theory of events which sees in the
world nothing but the regular rotation of Strophe and
Antistrophe, in the eternal choir of life and death.</p>
<p>For, in his remarks on the excesses of the Corcyrean
Revolution, Thucydides distinctly rests his idea of the
recurrence of history on the psychological grounds of the general
sameness of mankind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sufferings,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;which revolution
entailed upon the cities were many and terrible, such as have
occurred and always will occurs as long as human nature remains
the same, though in a severer or milder form, and varying in
their symptoms according to the variety of the particular
cases.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In peace and prosperity states and individuals have
better sentiments, because they are not confronted with imperious
necessities; but war takes away the easy supply of men&rsquo;s
wants, and so proves a hard taskmaster, which brings most
men&rsquo;s characters to a level with their fortunes.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is evident that here Thucydides
is ready to admit the variety of manifestations which external
causes bring about in their workings on the uniform character of
the nature of man.&nbsp; Yet, after all is said, these are
perhaps but very general statements: the ordinary effects of
peace and war are dwelt on, but there is no real analysis of the
immediate causes and general laws of the phenomena of life, nor
does Thucydides seem to recognise the truth that if humanity
proceeds in circles, the circles are always widening.</p>
<p>Perhaps we may say that with him the philosophy of history is
partly in the metaphysical stage, and see, in the progress of
this idea from Herodotus to Polybius, the exemplification of the
Comtian Law of the three stages of thought, the theological, the
metaphysical, and the scientific: for truly out of the vagueness
of theological mysticism this conception which we call the
Philosophy of History was raised to a scientific principle,
according to which the past was explained and the future
predicted by reference to general laws.</p>
<p>Now, just as the earliest account of the nature of the
progress of humanity is to be found in Plato, so in him we find
the first explicit attempt to found a universal philosophy of
history upon wide rational grounds.&nbsp; Having created an
ideally perfect state, the philosopher proceeds to give an
elaborate theory of the complex causes which produce revolutions,
of the moral effects of various forms of government and
education, of the rise of the criminal classes and their
connection with pauperism, and, in a word, to create history by
the deductive method and to proceed from <i>a priori</i>
psychological principles to discover the governing laws of the
apparent chaos of political life.</p>
<p>There have been many attempts since Plato to deduce from a
single philosophical principle all the phenomena which experience
subsequently verifies for us.&nbsp; Fichte thought he could
predict the world-plan from the idea of universal time.&nbsp;
Hegel dreamed he had found the key to the mysteries of life in
the development of freedom, and Krause in the categories of
being.&nbsp; But the one scientific basis on which the true
philosophy of history must rest is the complete knowledge of the
laws of human nature in all its wants, its aspirations, its
powers and its tendencies: and this great truth, which Thucydides
may be said in some measure to have apprehended, was given to us
first by Plato.</p>
<p>Now, it cannot be accurately said of this philosopher that
either his philosophy or his history is entirely and simply <i>a
priori</i>.&nbsp; <i>On est de son si&egrave;cle m&ecirc;me quand
on y proteste</i>, and so we find in him continual references to
the Spartan mode of life, the Pythagorean system, the general
characteristics of Greek tyrannies and Greek democracies.&nbsp;
For while, in his account of the method of forming an ideal
state, he says that the political artist is indeed to fix his
gaze on the sun of abstract truth in the heavens of the pure
reason, but is sometimes to turn to the realisation of the ideals
on earth: yet, after all, the general character of the Platonic
method, which is what we are specially concerned with, is
essentially deductive and <i>a priori</i>.&nbsp; And he himself,
in the building up of his Nephelococcygia, certainly starts with
a <i>&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&alpha;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf;
&pi;&#943;&nu;&alpha;&xi;</i>, making a clean sweep of all
history and all experience; and it was essentially as an <i>a
priori</i> theorist that he is criticised by Aristotle, as we
shall see later.</p>
<p>To proceed to closer details regarding the actual scheme of
the laws of political revolutions as drawn out by Plato, we must
first note that the primary cause of the decay of the ideal state
is the general principle, common to the vegetable and animal
worlds as well as to the world of history, that all created
things are fated to decay&mdash;a principle which, though
expressed in the terms of a mere metaphysical abstraction, is yet
perhaps in its essence scientific.&nbsp; For we too must hold
that a continuous redistribution of matter and motion is the
inevitable result of the nominal persistence of Force, and that
perfect equilibrium is as impossible in politics as it certainly
is in physics.</p>
<p>The secondary causes which mar the perfection of the Platonic
&lsquo;city of the sun&rsquo; are to be found in the intellectual
decay of the race consequent on injudicious marriages and in the
Philistine elevation of physical achievements over mental
culture; while the hierarchical succession of Timocracy and
Oligarchy, Democracy and Tyranny, is dwelt on at great length and
its causes analysed in a very dramatic and psychological manner,
if not in that sanctioned by the actual order of history.</p>
<p>And indeed it is apparent at first sight that the Platonic
succession of states represents rather the succession of ideas in
the philosophic mind than any historical succession of time.</p>
<p>Aristotle meets the whole simply by an appeal to facts.&nbsp;
If the theory of the periodic decay of all created things, he
urges, be scientific, it must be universal, and so true of all
the other states as well as of the ideal.&nbsp; Besides, a state
usually changes into its contrary and not to the form next to it;
so the ideal state would not change into Timocracy; while
Oligarchy, more often than Tyranny, succeeds Democracy.&nbsp;
Plato, besides, says nothing of what a Tyranny would change
to.&nbsp; According to the cycle theory it ought to pass into the
ideal state again, but as a fact one Tyranny is changed into
another as at Sicyon, or into a Democracy as at Syracuse, or into
an Aristocracy as at Carthage.&nbsp; The example of Sicily, too,
shows that an Oligarchy is often followed by a Tyranny, as at
Leontini and Gela.&nbsp; Besides, it is absurd to represent greed
as the chief motive of decay, or to talk of avarice as the root
of Oligarchy, when in nearly all true oligarchies money-making is
forbidden by law.&nbsp; And finally the Platonic theory neglects
the different kinds of democracies and of tyrannies.</p>
<p>Now nothing can be more important than this passage in
Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Politics</i> (<i>v.</i> 12.), which may he
said to mark an era in the evolution of historical
criticism.&nbsp; For there is nothing on which Aristotle insists
so strongly as that the generalisations from facts ought to be
added to the data of the <i>a priori</i> method&mdash;a principle
which we know to be true not merely of deductive speculative
politics but of physics also: for are not the residual phenomena
of chemists a valuable source of improvement in theory?</p>
<p>His own method is essentially historical though by no means
empirical.&nbsp; On the contrary, this far-seeing thinker,
rightly styled <i>il maestro di color che sanno</i>, may be said
to have apprehended clearly that the true method is neither
exclusively empirical nor exclusively speculative, but rather a
union of both in the process called Analysis or the
Interpretation of Facts, which has been defined as the
application to facts of such general conceptions as may fix the
important characteristics of the phenomena, and present them
permanently in their true relations.&nbsp; He too was the first
to point out, what even in our own day is incompletely
appreciated, that nature, including the development of man, is
not full of incoherent episodes like a bad tragedy, that
inconsistency and anomaly are as impossible in the moral as they
are in the physical world, and that where the superficial
observer thinks he sees a revolution the philosophical critic
discerns merely the gradual and rational evolution of the
inevitable results of certain antecedents.</p>
<p>And while admitting the necessity of a psychological basis for
the philosophy of history, he added to it the important truth
that man, to be apprehended in his proper position in the
universe as well as in his natural powers, must be studied from
below in the hierarchical progression of higher function from the
lower forms of life.&nbsp; The important maxim, that to obtain a
clear conception of anything we must &lsquo;study it in its
growth from the very beginning,&rsquo; is formally set down in
the opening of the <i>Politics</i>, where, indeed, we shall find
the other characteristic features of the modern Evolutionary
theory, such as the &lsquo;Differentiation of Function&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;Survival of the Fittest&rsquo; explicitly set
forth.</p>
<p>What a valuable step this was in the improvement of the method
of historical criticism it is needless to point out.&nbsp; By it,
one may say, the true thread was given to guide one&rsquo;s steps
through the bewildering labyrinth of facts.&nbsp; For history (to
use terms with which Aristotle has made us familiar) may be
looked at from two essentially different standpoints; either as a
work of art whose <i>&tau;&#941;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i> or
final cause is external to it and imposed on it from without; or
as an organism containing the law of its own development in
itself, and working out its perfection merely by the fact of
being what it is.&nbsp; Now, if we adopt the former, which we may
style the theological view, we shall be in continual danger of
tripping into the pitfall of some <i>a priori</i>
conclusion&mdash;that bourne from which, it has been truly said,
no traveller ever returns.</p>
<p>The latter is the only scientific theory and was apprehended
in its fulness by Aristotle, whose application of the inductive
method to history, and whose employment of the evolutionary
theory of humanity, show that he was conscious that the
philosophy of history is nothing separate from the facts of
history but is contained in them, and that the rational law of
the complex phenomena of life, like the ideal in the world of
thought, is to be reached through the facts, not superimposed on
them&mdash;<i>&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048;
&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&lambda;&#8182;&nu;</i> not
<i>&pi;&alpha;&rho;&#8048;
&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&lambda;&#8049;</i>.</p>
<p>And finally, in estimating the enormous debt which the science
of historical criticism owes to Aristotle, we must not pass over
his attitude towards those two great difficulties in the
formation of a philosophy of history on which I have touched
above.&nbsp; I mean the assertion of extra-natural interference
with the normal development of the world and of the incalculable
influence exercised by the power of free will.</p>
<p>Now, as regards the former, he may be said to have neglected
it entirely.&nbsp; The special acts of providence proceeding from
God&rsquo;s immediate government of the world, which Herodotus
saw as mighty landmarks in history, would have been to him
essentially disturbing elements in that universal reign of law,
the extent of whose limitless empire he of all the great thinkers
of antiquity was the first explicitly to recognise.</p>
<p>Standing aloof from the popular religion as well as from the
deeper conceptions of Herodotus and the Tragic School, he no
longer thought of God as of one with fair limbs and treacherous
face haunting wood and glade, nor would he see in him a jealous
judge continually interfering in the world&rsquo;s history to
bring the wicked to punishment and the proud to a fall.&nbsp; God
to him was the incarnation of the pure Intellect, a being whose
activity was the contemplation of his own perfection, one whom
Philosophy might imitate but whom prayers could never move, to
the sublime indifference of whose passionless wisdom what were
the sons of men, their desires or their sins?&nbsp; While, as
regards the other difficulty and the formation of a philosophy of
history, the conflict of free will with general laws appears
first in Greek thought in the usual theological form in which all
great ideas seem to be cradled at their birth.</p>
<p>It was such legends as those of &OElig;dipus and Adrastus,
exemplifying the struggles of individual humanity against the
overpowering force of circumstances and necessity, which gave to
the early Greeks those same lessons which we of modern days draw,
in somewhat less artistic fashion, from the study of statistics
and the laws of physiology.</p>
<p>In Aristotle, of course, there is no trace of supernatural
influence.&nbsp; The Furies, which drive their victim into sin
first and then punishment, are no longer &lsquo;viper-tressed
goddesses with eyes and mouth aflame,&rsquo; but those evil
thoughts which harbour within the impure soul.&nbsp; In this, as
in all other points, to arrive at Aristotle is to reach the pure
atmosphere of scientific and modern thought.</p>
<p>But while he rejected pure necessitarianism in its crude form
as essentially a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of life, he was
fully conscious of the fact that the will is not a mysterious and
ultimate unit of force beyond which we cannot go and whose
special characteristic is inconsistency, but a certain creative
attitude of the mind which is, from the first, continually
influenced by habits, education and circumstance; so absolutely
modifiable, in a word, that the good and the bad man alike seem
to lose the power of free will; for the one is morally unable to
sin, the other physically incapacitated for reformation.</p>
<p>And of the influence of climate and temperature in forming the
nature of man (a conception perhaps pressed too far in modern
days when the &lsquo;race theory&rsquo; is supposed to be a
sufficient explanation of the Hindoo, and the latitude and
longitude of a country the best guide to its morals <a
name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a>) Aristotle is completely unaware.&nbsp;
I do not allude to such smaller points as the oligarchical
tendencies of a horse-breeding country and the democratic
influence of the proximity of the sea (important though they are
for the consideration of Greek history), but rather to those
wider views in the seventh book of his <i>Politics</i>, where he
attributes the happy union in the Greek character of intellectual
attainments with the spirit of progress to the temperate climate
they enjoyed, and points out how the extreme cold of the north
dulls the mental faculties of its inhabitants and renders them
incapable of social organisation or extended empire; while to the
enervating heat of eastern countries was due that want of spirit
and bravery which then, as now, was the characteristic of the
population in that quarter of the globe.</p>
<p>Thucydides has shown the causal connection between political
revolutions and the fertility of the soil, but goes a step
farther and points out the psychological influences on a
people&rsquo;s character exercised by the various extremes of
climate&mdash;in both cases the first appearance of a most
valuable form of historical criticism.</p>
<p>To the development of Dialectic, as to God, intervals of time
are of no account.&nbsp; From Plato and Aristotle we pass direct
to Polybius.</p>
<p>The progress of thought from the philosopher of the Academe to
the Arcadian historian may be best illustrated by a comparison of
the method by which each of the three writers, whom I have
selected as the highest expression of the rationalism of his
respective age, attained to his ideal state: for the latter
conception may be in a measure regarded as representing the most
spiritual principle which they could discern in history.</p>
<p>Now, Plato created his on <i>a priori</i> principles;
Aristotle formed his by an analysis of existing constitutions;
Polybius found his realised for him in the actual world of
fact.&nbsp; Aristotle criticised the deductive speculations of
Plato by means of inductive negative instances, but Polybius will
not take the &lsquo;Cloud City&rsquo; of the <i>Republic</i> into
account at all.&nbsp; He compares it to an athlete who has never
run on &lsquo;Constitution Hill,&rsquo; to a statue so beautiful
that it is entirely removed from the ordinary conditions of
humanity, and consequently from the canons of criticism.</p>
<p>The Roman state had attained in his eyes, by means of the
mutual counteraction of three opposing forces, <a
name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a> that stable equilibrium in politics
which was the ideal of all the theoretical writers of
antiquity.&nbsp; And in connection with this point it will be
convenient to notice here how much truth there is contained in
the accusation often brought against the ancients that they knew
nothing of the idea of Progress, for the meaning of many of their
speculations will be hidden from us if we do not try and
comprehend first what their aim was, and secondly why it was
so.</p>
<p>Now, like all wide generalities, this statement is at least
inaccurate.&nbsp; The prayer of Plato&rsquo;s ideal
City&mdash;<i>&#7952;&xi; &#7936;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#8182;&nu;
&#7936;&mu;&epsilon;&#8055;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</i>,
<i>&kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#7952;&xi;
&#8032;&phi;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&mu;&#8182;&nu;
&#8032;&phi;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&mu;&omega;&tau;&#8051;&rho;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&#7936;&epsilon;&#8054; &tau;&omicron;&#8058;&sigmaf;
&#7952;&kappa;&gamma;&#8057;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&gamma;&#8055;&gamma;&nu;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</i>,
might be written as a text over the door of the last Temple to
Humanity raised by the disciples of Fourier and Saint-Simon, but
it is certainly true that their ideal principle was order and
permanence, not indefinite progress.&nbsp; For, setting aside the
artistic prejudices which would have led the Greeks to reject
this idea of unlimited improvement, we may note that the modern
conception of progress rests partly on the new enthusiasm and
worship of humanity, partly on the splendid hopes of material
improvements in civilisation which applied science has held out
to us, two influences from which ancient Greek thought seems to
have been strangely free.&nbsp; For the Greeks marred the perfect
humanism of the great men whom they worshipped, by imputing to
them divinity and its supernatural powers; while their science
was eminently speculative and often almost mystic in its
character, aiming at culture and not utility, at higher
spirituality and more intense reverence for law, rather than at
the increased facilities of locomotion and the cheap production
of common things about which our modern scientific school ceases
not to boast.&nbsp; And lastly, and perhaps chiefly, we must
remember that the &lsquo;plague spot of all Greek states,&rsquo;
as one of their own writers has called it, was the terrible
insecurity to life and property which resulted from the factions
and revolutions which ceased not to trouble Greece at all times,
raising a spirit of fanaticism such as religion raised in the
middle ages of Europe.</p>
<p>These considerations, then, will enable us to understand first
how it was that, radical and unscrupulous reformers as the Greek
political theorists were, yet, their end once attained, no modern
conservatives raised such outcry against the slightest
innovation.&nbsp; Even acknowledged improvements in such things
as the games of children or the modes of music were regarded by
them with feelings of extreme apprehension as the herald of the
<i>drapeau rouge</i> of reform.&nbsp; And secondly, it will show
us how it was that Polybius found his ideal in the commonwealth
of Rome, and Aristotle, like Mr. Bright, in the middle
classes.&nbsp; Polybius, however, is not content merely with
pointing out his ideal state, but enters at considerable length
into the question of those general laws whose consideration forms
the chief essential of the philosophy of history.</p>
<p>He starts by accepting the general principle that all things
are fated to decay (which I noticed in the case of Plato), and
that &lsquo;as iron produces rust and as wood breeds the animals
that destroy it, so every state has in it the seeds of its own
corruption.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is not, however, content to rest
there, but proceeds to deal with the more immediate causes of
revolutions, which he says are twofold in nature, either external
or internal.&nbsp; Now, the former, depending as they do on the
synchronous conjunction of other events outside the sphere of
scientific estimation, are from their very character
incalculable; but the latter, though assuming many forms, always
result from the over-great preponderance of any single element to
the detriment of the others, the rational law lying at the base
of all varieties of political changes being that stability can
result only from the statical equilibrium produced by the
counteraction of opposing parts, since the more simple a
constitution is the more it is insecure.&nbsp; Plato had pointed
out before how the extreme liberty of a democracy always resulted
in despotism, but Polybius analyses the law and shows the
scientific principles on which it rests.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the instability of pure constitutions forms an
important era in the philosophy of history.&nbsp; Its special
applicability to the politics of our own day has been illustrated
in the rise of the great Napoleon, when the French state had lost
those divisions of caste and prejudice, of landed aristocracy and
moneyed interest, institutions in which the vulgar see only
barriers to Liberty but which are indeed the only possible
defences against the coming of that periodic Sirius of politics,
the <i>&tau;&#8059;&rho;&alpha;&nu;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&#7952;&kappa;
&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&#8165;&#8055;&zeta;&eta;&sigmaf;</i>.</p>
<p>There is a principle which Tocqueville never wearies of
explaining, and which has been subsumed by Mr. Herbert Spencer
under that general law common to all organic bodies which we call
the Instability of the Homogeneous.&nbsp; The various
manifestations of this law, as shown in the normal, regular
revolutions and evolutions of the different forms of government,
<a name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a> are expounded with great clearness by
Polybius, who claimed for his theory, in the Thucydidean spirit,
that it is a <i>&kappa;&tau;&#8134;&mu;&alpha; &#7952;&sigmaf;
&#7936;&epsilon;&#943;</i>, not a mere
<i>&#7936;&gamma;&#974;&nu;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&alpha;
&#7952;&sigmaf; &tau;&#8056;
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&chi;&rho;&#8134;&mu;&alpha;</i>, and that
a knowledge of it will enable the impartial observer <a
name="citation63b"></a><a href="#footnote63b"
class="citation">[63b]</a> to discover at any time what period of
its constitutional evolution any particular state has already
reached and into what form it will be next differentiated, though
possibly the exact time of the changes may be more or less
uncertain. <a name="citation63c"></a><a href="#footnote63c"
class="citation">[63c]</a></p>
<p>Now in this necessarily incomplete account of the laws of
political revolutions as expounded by Polybius enough perhaps has
been said to show what is his true position in the rational
development of the &lsquo;Idea&rsquo; which I have called the
Philosophy of History, because it is the unifying of
history.&nbsp; Seen darkly as it is through the glass of religion
in the pages of Herodotus, more metaphysical than scientific with
Thucydides, Plato strove to seize it by the eagle-flight of
speculation, to reach it with the eager grasp of a soul impatient
of those slower and surer inductive methods which Aristotle, in
his trenchant criticism of his greater master, showed were more
brilliant than any vague theory, if the test of brilliancy is
truth.</p>
<p>What then is the position of Polybius?&nbsp; Does any new
method remain for him?&nbsp; Polybius was one of those many men
who are born too late to be original.&nbsp; To Thucydides belongs
the honour of being the first in the history of Greek thought to
discern the supreme calm of law and order underlying the fitful
storms of life, and Plato and Aristotle each represents a great
new principle.&nbsp; To Polybius belongs the office&mdash;how
noble an office he made it his writings show&mdash;of making more
explicit the ideas which were implicit in his predecessors, of
showing that they were of wider applicability and perhaps of
deeper meaning than they had seemed before, of examining with
more minuteness the laws which they had discovered, and finally
of pointing out more clearly than any one had done the range of
science and the means it offered for analysing the present and
predicting what was to come.&nbsp; His office thus was to gather
up what they had left, to give their principles new life by a
wider application.</p>
<p>Polybius ends this great diapason of Greek thought.&nbsp; When
the Philosophy of history appears next, as in Plutarch&rsquo;s
tract on &lsquo;Why God&rsquo;s anger is delayed,&rsquo; the
pendulum of thought had swung back to where it began.&nbsp; His
theory was introduced to the Romans under the cultured style of
Cicero, and was welcomed by them as the philosophical panegyric
of their state.&nbsp; The last notice of it in Latin literature
is in the pages of Tacitus, who alludes to the stable polity
formed out of these elements as a constitution easier to commend
than to produce and in no case lasting.&nbsp; Yet Polybius had
seen the future with no uncertain eye, and had prophesied the
rise of the Empire from the unbalanced power of the ochlocracy
fifty years and more before there was joy in the Julian household
over the birth of that boy who, born to power as the champion of
the people, died wearing the purple of a king.</p>
<p>No attitude of historical criticism is more important than the
means by which the ancients attained to the philosophy of
history.&nbsp; The principle of heredity can be exemplified in
literature as well as in organic life: Aristotle, Plato and
Polybius are the lineal ancestors of Fichte and Hegel, of Vico
and Cousin, of Montesquieu and Tocqueville.</p>
<p>As my aim is not to give an account of historians but to point
out those great thinkers whose methods have furthered the advance
of this spirit of historical criticism, I shall pass over those
annalists and chroniclers who intervened between Thucydides and
Polybius.&nbsp; Yet perhaps it may serve to throw new light on
the real nature of this spirit and its intimate connection with
all other forms of advanced thought if I give some estimate of
the character and rise of those many influences prejudicial to
the scientific study of history which cause such a wide gap
between these two historians.</p>
<p>Foremost among these is the growing influence of rhetoric and
the Isocratean school, which seems to have regarded history as an
arena for the display either of pathos or paradoxes, not a
scientific investigation into laws.</p>
<p>The new age is the age of style.&nbsp; The same spirit of
exclusive attention to form which made Euripides often, like
Swinburne, prefer music to meaning and melody to morality, which
gave to the later Greek statues that refined effeminacy, that
overstrained gracefulness of attitude, was felt in the sphere of
history.&nbsp; The rules laid down for historical composition are
those relating to the &aelig;sthetic value of digressions, the
legality of employing more than one metaphor in the same
sentence, and the like; and historians are ranked not by their
power of estimating evidence but by the goodness of the Greek
they write.</p>
<p>I must note also the important influence on literature
exercised by Alexander the Great; for while his travels
encouraged the more accurate research of geography, the very
splendour of his achievements seems to have brought history again
into the sphere of romance.&nbsp; The appearance of all great men
in the world is followed invariably by the rise of that
mythop&oelig;ic spirit and that tendency to look for the
marvellous, which is so fatal to true historical criticism.&nbsp;
An Alexander, a Napoleon, a Francis of Assisi and a Mahomet are
thought to be outside the limiting conditions of rational law,
just as comets were supposed to be not very long ago.&nbsp; While
the founding of that city of Alexandria, in which Western and
Eastern thought met with such strange result to both, diverted
the critical tendencies of the Greek spirit into questions of
grammar, philology and the like, the narrow, artificial
atmosphere of that University town (as we may call it) was fatal
to the development of that independent and speculative spirit of
research which strikes out new methods of inquiry, of which
historical criticism is one.</p>
<p>The Alexandrines combined a great love of learning with an
ignorance of the true principles of research, an enthusiastic
spirit for accumulating materials with a wonderful incapacity to
use them.&nbsp; Not among the hot sands of Egypt, or the Sophists
of Athens, but from the very heart of Greece rises the man of
genius on whose influence in the evolution of the philosophy of
history I have a short time ago dwelt.&nbsp; Born in the serene
and pure air of the clear uplands of Arcadia, Polybius may be
said to reproduce in his work the character of the place which
gave him birth.&nbsp; For, of all the historians&mdash;I do not
say of antiquity but of all time&mdash;none is more rationalistic
than he, none more free from any belief in the &lsquo;visions and
omens, the monstrous legends, the grovelling superstitions and
unmanly craving for the supernatural&rsquo;
(<i>&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&#7936;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&nu;&omicron;&#8166;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&kappa;&#8061;&delta;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</i>
<a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68"
class="citation">[68]</a>) which he himself is compelled to
notice as the characteristics of some of the historians who
preceded him.&nbsp; Fortunate in the land which bore him, he was
no less blessed in the wondrous time of his birth.&nbsp; For,
representing in himself the spiritual supremacy of the Greek
intellect and allied in bonds of chivalrous friendship to the
world-conqueror of his day, he seems led as it were by the hand
of Fate &lsquo;to comprehend,&rsquo; as has been said,
&lsquo;more clearly than the Romans themselves the historical
position of Rome,&rsquo; and to discern with greater insight than
all other men could those two great resultants of ancient
civilisation, the material empire of the city of the seven hills,
and the intellectual sovereignty of Hellas.</p>
<p>Before his own day, he says, <a name="citation69a"></a><a
href="#footnote69a" class="citation">[69a]</a> the events of the
world were unconnected and separate and the histories confined to
particular countries.&nbsp; Now, for the first time the universal
empire of the Romans rendered a universal history possible. <a
name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b"
class="citation">[69b]</a>&nbsp; This, then, is the august motive
of his work: to trace the gradual rise of this Italian city from
the day when the first legion crossed the narrow strait of
Messina and landed on the fertile fields of Sicily to the time
when Corinth in the East and Carthage in the West fell before the
resistless wave of empire and the eagles of Rome passed on the
wings of universal victory from Calpe and the Pillars of Hercules
to Syria and the Nile.&nbsp; At the same time he recognised that
the scheme of Rome&rsquo;s empire was worked out under the
&aelig;gis of God&rsquo;s will. <a name="citation69c"></a><a
href="#footnote69c" class="citation">[69c]</a>&nbsp; For, as one
of the Middle Age scribes most truly says, the
<i>&tau;&#8059;&chi;&eta;</i> of Polybius is that power which we
Christians call God; the second aim, as one may call it, of his
history is to point out the rational and human and natural causes
which brought this result, distinguishing, as we should say,
between God&rsquo;s mediate and immediate government of the
world.</p>
<p>With any direct intervention of God in the normal development
of Man, he will have nothing to do: still less with any idea of
chance as a factor in the phenomena of life.&nbsp; Chance and
miracles, he says, are mere expressions for our ignorance of
rational causes.&nbsp; The spirit of rationalism which we
recognised in Herodotus as a vague uncertain attitude and which
appears in Thucydides as a consistent attitude of mind never
argued about or even explained, is by Polybius analysed and
formulated as the great instrument of historical research.</p>
<p>Herodotus, while believing on principle in the supernatural,
yet was sceptical at times.&nbsp; Thucydides simply ignored the
supernatural.&nbsp; He did not discuss it, but he annihilated it
by explaining history without it.&nbsp; Polybius enters at length
into the whole question and explains its origin and the method of
treating it.&nbsp; Herodotus would have believed in
Scipio&rsquo;s dream.&nbsp; Thucydides would have ignored it
entirely.&nbsp; Polybius explains it.&nbsp; He is the culmination
of the rational progression of Dialectic.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;shows a foolish mind more
than the attempt to account for any phenomena on the principle of
chance or supernatural intervention.&nbsp; History is a search
for rational causes, and there is nothing in the world&mdash;even
those phenomena which seem to us the most remote from law and
improbable&mdash;which is not the logical and inevitable result
of certain rational antecedents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some things, of course, are to be rejected <i>a priori</i>
without entering into the subject: &lsquo;As regards such
miracles,&rsquo; he says, <a name="citation71"></a><a
href="#footnote71" class="citation">[71]</a> &lsquo;as that on a
certain statue of Artemis rain or snow never falls though the
statue stands in the open air, or that those who enter
God&rsquo;s shrine in Arcadia lose their natural shadows, I
cannot really be expected to argue upon the subject.&nbsp; For
these things are not only utterly improbable but absolutely
impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For us to argue reasonably on an acknowledged absurdity
is as vain a task as trying to catch water in a sieve; it is
really to admit the possibility of the supernatural, which is the
very point at issue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What Polybius felt was that to admit the possibility of a
miracle is to annihilate the possibility of history: for just as
scientific and chemical experiments would be either impossible or
useless if exposed to the chance of continued interference on the
part of some foreign body, so the laws and principles which
govern history, the causes of phenomena, the evolution of
progress, the whole science, in a word, of man&rsquo;s dealings
with his own race and with nature, will remain a sealed book to
him who admits the possibility of extra-natural interference.</p>
<p>The stories of miracles, then, are to be rejected on <i>a
priori</i> rational grounds, but in the case of events which we
know to have happened the scientific historian will not rest till
he has discovered their natural causes which, for instance, in
the case of the wonderful rise of the Roman Empire&mdash;the most
marvellous thing, Polybius says, which God ever brought about <a
name="citation72a"></a><a href="#footnote72a"
class="citation">[72a]</a>&mdash;are to be found in the
excellence of their constitution (<i>&tau;&#8135;
&#7984;&delta;&iota;&#972;&tau;&eta;&tau;&iota;
&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&tau;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;</i>),
the wisdom of their advisers, their splendid military
arrangements, and their superstition (<i>&tau;&#8135;
&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8055;&#8115;</i>).&nbsp;
For while Polybius regarded the revealed religion as, of course,
objective reality of truth, <a name="citation72b"></a><a
href="#footnote72b" class="citation">[72b]</a> he laid great
stress on its moral subjective influence, going, in one passage
on the subject, even so far as almost to excuse the introduction
of the supernatural in very small quantities into history on
account of the extremely good effect it would have on pious
people.</p>
<p>But perhaps there is no passage in the whole of ancient and
modern history which breathes such a manly and splendid spirit of
rationalism as one preserved to us in the Vatican&mdash;strange
resting-place for it!&mdash;in which he treats of the terrible
decay of population which had fallen on his native land in his
own day, and which by the general orthodox public was regarded as
a special judgment of God sending childlessness on women as a
punishment for the sins of the people.&nbsp; For it was a
disaster quite without parallel in the history of the land, and
entirely unforeseen by any of its political-economy writers who,
on the contrary, were always anticipating that danger would arise
from an excess of population overrunning its means of
subsistence, and becoming unmanageable through its size.&nbsp;
Polybius, however, will have nothing to do with either priest or
worker of miracles in this matter.&nbsp; He will not even seek
that &lsquo;sacred Heart of Greece,&rsquo; Delphi, Apollo&rsquo;s
shrine, whose inspiration even Thucydides admitted and before
whose wisdom Socrates bowed.&nbsp; How foolish, he says, were the
man who on this matter would pray to God.&nbsp; We must search
for the rational causes, and the causes are seen to be clear, and
the method of prevention also.&nbsp; He then proceeds to notice
how all this arose from the general reluctance to marriage and to
bearing the expense of educating a large family which resulted
from the carelessness and avarice of the men of his day, and he
explains on entirely rational principles the whole of this
apparently supernatural judgment.</p>
<p>Now, it is to be borne in mind that while his rejection of
miracles as violation of inviolable laws is entirely <i>a
priori</i>&mdash;for discussion of such a matter is, of course,
impossible for a rational thinker&mdash;yet his rejection of
supernatural intervention rests entirely on the scientific
grounds of the necessity of looking for natural causes.&nbsp; And
he is quite logical in maintaining his position on these
principles.&nbsp; For, where it is either difficult or impossible
to assign any rational cause for phenomena, or to discover their
laws, he acquiesces reluctantly in the alternative of admitting
some extra-natural interference which his essentially scientific
method of treating the matter has logically forced on him,
approving, for instance, of prayers for rain, on the express
ground that the laws of meteorology had not yet been
ascertained.&nbsp; He would, of course, have been the first to
welcome our modern discoveries in the matter.&nbsp; The passage
in question is in every way one of the most interesting in his
whole work, not, of course, as signifying any inclination on his
part to acquiesce in the supernatural, but because it shows how
essentially logical and rational his method of argument was, and
how candid and fair his mind.</p>
<p>Having now examined Polybius&rsquo;s attitude towards the
supernatural and the general ideas which guided his research, I
will proceed to examine the method he pursued in his scientific
investigation of the complex phenomena of life.&nbsp; For, as I
have said before in the course of this essay, what is important
in all great writers is not so much the results they arrive at as
the methods they pursue.&nbsp; The increased knowledge of facts
may alter any conclusion in history as in physical science, and
the canons of speculative historical credibility must be
acknowledged to appeal rather to that subjective attitude of mind
which we call the historic sense than to any formulated objective
rules.&nbsp; But a scientific method is a gain for all time, and
the true if not the only progress of historical criticism
consists in the improvement of the instruments of research.</p>
<p>Now first, as regards his conception of history, I have
already pointed out that it was to him essentially a search for
causes, a problem to be solved, not a picture to be painted, a
scientific investigation into laws and tendencies, not a mere
romantic account of startling incident and wondrous
adventure.&nbsp; Thucydides, in the opening of his great work,
had sounded the first note of the scientific conception of
history.&nbsp; &lsquo;The absence of romance in my pages,&rsquo;
he says, &lsquo;will, I fear, detract somewhat from its value,
but I have written my work not to be the exploit of a passing
hour but as the possession of all time.&rsquo; <a
name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a>&nbsp; Polybius follows with words
almost entirely similar.&nbsp; If, he says, we banish from
history the consideration of causes, methods and motives
(<i>&tau;&#8056; &delta;&iota;&#8048; &tau;&#943;</i>,
<i>&kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &pi;&omega;&sigmaf;</i>,
<i>&kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &tau;&#943;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&chi;&#940;&rho;&iota;&nu;</i>), and refuse to consider how far
the result of anything is its rational consequent, what is left
is a mere
<i>&#7936;&gamma;&#8061;&nu;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&alpha;</i>, not a
<i>&mu;&#940;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;</i>, an oratorical essay
which may give pleasure for the moment, but which is entirely
without any scientific value for the explanation of the
future.&nbsp; Elsewhere he says that &lsquo;history robbed of the
exposition of its causes and laws is a profitless thing, though
it may allure a fool.&rsquo;&nbsp; And all through his history
the same point is put forward and exemplified in every
fashion.</p>
<p>So far for the conception of history.&nbsp; Now for the
groundwork.&nbsp; As regards the character of the phenomena to be
selected by the scientific investigator, Aristotle had laid down
the general formula that nature should be studied in her normal
manifestations.&nbsp; Polybius, true to his character of applying
explicitly the principles implicit in the work of others, follows
out the doctrine of Aristotle, and lays particular stress on the
rational and undisturbed character of the development of the
Roman constitution as affording special facilities for the
discovery of the laws of its progress.&nbsp; Political
revolutions result from causes either external or internal.&nbsp;
The former are mere disturbing forces which lie outside the
sphere of scientific calculation.&nbsp; It is the latter which
are important for the establishing of principles and the
elucidation of the sequences of rational evolution.</p>
<p>He thus may be said to have anticipated one of the most
important truths of the modern methods of investigation: I mean
that principle which lays down that just as the study of
physiology should precede the study of pathology, just as the
laws of disease are best discovered by the phenomena presented in
health, so the method of arriving at all great social and
political truths is by the investigation of those cases where
development has been normal, rational and undisturbed.</p>
<p>The critical canon that the more a people has been interfered
with, the more difficult it becomes to generalise the laws of its
progress and to analyse the separate forces of its civilisation,
is one the validity of which is now generally recognised by those
who pretend to a scientific treatment of all history: and while
we have seen that Aristotle anticipated it in a general formula,
to Polybius belongs the honour of being the first to apply it
explicitly in the sphere of history.</p>
<p>I have shown how to this great scientific historian the motive
of his work was essentially the search for causes; and true to
his analytical spirit he is careful to examine what a cause
really is and in what part of the antecedents of any consequent
it is to be looked for.&nbsp; To give an illustration: As regards
the origin of the war with Perseus, some assigned as causes the
expulsion of Abrupolis by Perseus, the expedition of the latter
to Delphi, the plot against Eumenes and the seizure of the
ambassadors in B&oelig;otia; of these incidents the two former,
Polybius points out, were merely the pretexts, the two latter
merely the occasions of the war.&nbsp; The war was really a
legacy left to Perseus by his father, who was determined to fight
it out with Rome. <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a></p>
<p>Here as elsewhere he is not originating any new idea.&nbsp;
Thucydides had pointed out the difference between the real and
the alleged cause, and the Aristotelian dictum about revolutions,
<i>&omicron;&#8016; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054;
&mu;&iota;&kappa;&rho;&#8182;&nu; &#7936;&lambda;&lambda;&rsquo;
&#7952;&kappa; &mu;&iota;&kappa;&rho;&#8182;&nu;</i>, draws the
distinction between cause and occasion with the brilliancy of an
epigram.&nbsp; But the explicit and rational investigation of the
difference between <i>&alpha;&#7984;&tau;&#943;&alpha;</i>,
<i>&#7936;&rho;&chi;&#8052;</i>, and
<i>&pi;&rho;&#972;&phi;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</i> was
reserved for Polybius.&nbsp; No canon of historical criticism can
be said to be of more real value than that involved in this
distinction, and the overlooking of it has filled our histories
with the contemptible accounts of the intrigues of courtiers and
of kings and the petty plottings of backstairs
influence&mdash;particulars interesting, no doubt, to those who
would ascribe the Reformation to Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s pretty face,
the Persian war to the influence of a doctor or a curtain-lecture
from Atossa, or the French Revolution to Madame de Maintenon, but
without any value for those who aim at any scientific treatment
of history.</p>
<p>But the question of method, to which I am compelled always to
return, is not yet exhausted.&nbsp; There is another aspect in
which it may be regarded, and I shall now proceed to treat of
it.</p>
<p>One of the greatest difficulties with which the modern
historian has to contend is the enormous complexity of the facts
which come under his notice: D&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s suggestion
that at the end of every century a selection of facts should be
made and the rest burned (if it was really intended seriously)
could not, of course, be entertained for a moment.&nbsp; A
problem loses all its value when it becomes simplified, and the
world would be all the poorer if the Sibyl of History burned her
volumes.&nbsp; Besides, as Gibbon pointed out, &lsquo;a
Montesquieu will detect in the most insignificant fact relations
which the vulgar overlook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nor can the scientific investigator of history isolate the
particular elements, which he desires to examine, from disturbing
and extraneous causes, as the experimental chemist can do (though
sometimes, as in the case of lunatic asylums and prisons, he is
enabled to observe phenomena in a certain degree of
isolation).&nbsp; So he is compelled either to use the deductive
mode of arguing from general laws or to employ the method of
abstraction, which gives a fictitious isolation to phenomena
never so isolated in actual existence.&nbsp; And this is exactly
what Polybius has done as well as Thucydides.&nbsp; For, as has
been well remarked, there is in the works of these two writers a
certain plastic unity of type and motive; whatever they write is
penetrated through and through with a specific quality, a
singleness and concentration of purpose, which we may contrast
with the more comprehensive width as manifested not merely in the
modern mind, but also in Herodotus.&nbsp; Thucydides, regarding
society as influenced entirely by political motives, took no
account of forces of a different nature, and consequently his
results, like those of most modern political economists, have to
be modified largely <a name="citation81"></a><a
href="#footnote81" class="citation">[81]</a> before they come to
correspond with what we know was the actual state of fact.&nbsp;
Similarly, Polybius will deal only with those forces which tended
to bring the civilised world under the dominion of Rome (ix. 1),
and in the Thucydidean spirit points out the want of
picturesqueness and romance in his pages which is the result of
the abstract method (<i>&tau;&#8056;
&mu;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&#8050;&sigmaf;
&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&tau;&#940;&xi;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;</i>)
being careful also to tell us that his rejection of all other
forces is essentially deliberate and the result of a preconceived
theory and by no means due to carelessness of any kind.</p>
<p>Now, of the general value of the abstract method and the
legality of its employment in the sphere of history, this is
perhaps not the suitable occasion for any discussion.&nbsp; It
is, however, in all ways worthy of note that Polybius is not
merely conscious of, but dwells with particular weight on, the
fact which is usually urged as the strongest objection to the
employment of the abstract method&mdash;I mean the conception of
a society as a sort of human organism whose parts are
indissolubly connected with one another and all affected when one
member is in any way agitated.&nbsp; This conception of the
organic nature of society appears first in Plato and Aristotle,
who apply it to cities.&nbsp; Polybius, as his wont is, expands
it to be a general characteristic of all history.&nbsp; It is an
idea of the very highest importance, especially to a man like
Polybius whose thoughts are continually turned towards the
essential unity of history and the impossibility of
isolation.</p>
<p>Farther, as regards the particular method of investigating
that group of phenomena obtained for him by the abstract method,
he will adopt, he tells us, neither the purely deductive nor the
purely inductive mode but the union of both.&nbsp; In other
words, he formally adopts that method of analysis upon the
importance of which I have dwelt before.</p>
<p>And lastly, while, without doubt, enormous simplicity in the
elements under consideration is the result of the employment of
the abstract method, even within the limit thus obtained a
certain selection must be made, and a selection involves a
theory.&nbsp; For the facts of life cannot be tabulated with as
great an ease as the colours of birds and insects can be
tabulated.&nbsp; Now, Polybius points out that those phenomena
particularly are to be dwelt on which may serve as a
<i>&pi;&alpha;&rho;&#940;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&gamma;&mu;&alpha;</i>
or sample, and show the character of the tendencies of the age as
clearly as &lsquo;a single drop from a full cask will be enough
to disclose the nature of the whole contents.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
recognition of the importance of single facts, not in themselves
but because of the spirit they represent, is extremely
scientific; for we know that from the single bone, or tooth even,
the anatomist can recreate entirely the skeleton of the primeval
horse, and the botanist tell the character of the flora and fauna
of a district from a single specimen.</p>
<p>Regarding truth as &lsquo;the most divine thing in
Nature,&rsquo; the very &lsquo;eye and light of history without
which it moves a blind thing,&rsquo; Polybius spared no pains in
the acquisition of historical materials or in the study of the
sciences of politics and war, which he considered were so
essential to the training of the scientific historian, and the
labour he took is mirrored in the many ways in which he
criticises other authorities.</p>
<p>There is something, as a rule, slightly contemptible about
ancient criticism.&nbsp; The modern idea of the critic as the
interpreter, the expounder of the beauty and excellence of the
work he selects, seems quite unknown.&nbsp; Nothing can be more
captious or unfair, for instance, than the method by which
Aristotle criticised the ideal state of Plato in his ethical
works, and the passages quoted by Polybius from Tim&aelig;us show
that the latter historian fully deserved the punning name given
to him.&nbsp; But in Polybius there is, I think, little of that
bitterness and pettiness of spirit which characterises most other
writers, and an incidental story he tells of his relations with
one of the historians whom he criticised shows that he was a man
of great courtesy and refinement of taste&mdash;as, indeed,
befitted one who had lived always in the society of those who
were of great and noble birth.</p>
<p>Now, as regards the character of the canons by which he
criticises the works of other authors, in the majority of cases
he employs simply his own geographical and military knowledge,
showing, for instance, the impossibility in the accounts given of
Nabis&rsquo;s march from Sparta simply by his acquaintance with
the spots in question; or the inconsistency of those of the
battle of Issus; or of the accounts given by Ephorus of the
battles of Leuctra and Mantinea.&nbsp; In the latter case he
says, if any one will take the trouble to measure out the ground
of the site of the battle and then test the man&oelig;uvres
given, he will find how inaccurate the accounts are.</p>
<p>In other cases he appeals to public documents, the importance
of which he was always foremost in recognising; showing, for
instance, by a document in the public archives of Rhodes how
inaccurate were the accounts given of the battle of Lade by Zeno
and Antisthenes.&nbsp; Or he appeals to psychological
probability, rejecting, for instance, the scandalous stories told
of Philip of Macedon, simply from the king&rsquo;s general
greatness of character, and arguing that a boy so well educated
and so respectably connected as Demochares (xii. 14) could never
have been guilty of that of which evil rumour accused him.</p>
<p>But the chief object of his literary censure is Tim&aelig;us,
who had been unsparing of his strictures on others.&nbsp; The
general point which he makes against him, impugning his accuracy
as a historian, is that he derived his knowledge of history not
from the dangerous perils of a life of action but in the secure
indolence of a narrow scholastic life.&nbsp; There is, indeed, no
point on which he is so vehement as this.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
history,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;written in a library gives as
lifeless and as inaccurate a picture of history as a painting
which is copied not from a living animal but from a stuffed
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is more difference, he says in another place, between
the history of an eye-witness and that of one whose knowledge
comes from books, than there is between the scenes of real life
and the fictitious landscapes of theatrical scenery.&nbsp;
Besides this, he enters into somewhat elaborate detailed
criticism of passages where he thought Tim&aelig;us was following
a wrong method and perverting truth, passages which it will be
worth while to examine in detail.</p>
<p>Tim&aelig;us, from the fact of there being a Roman custom to
shoot a war-horse on a stated day, argued back to the Trojan
origin of that people.&nbsp; Polybius, on the other hand, points
out that the inference is quite unwarrantable, because
horse-sacrifices are ordinary institutions common to all
barbarous tribes.&nbsp; Tim&aelig;us here, as was common with
Greek writers, is arguing back from some custom of the present to
an historical event in the past.&nbsp; Polybius really is
employing the comparative method, showing how the custom was an
ordinary step in the civilisation of every early people.</p>
<p>In another place, <a name="citation86"></a><a
href="#footnote86" class="citation">[86]</a> he shows how
illogical is the scepticism of Tim&aelig;us as regards the
existence of the Bull of Phalaris simply by appealing to the
statue of the Bull, which was still to be seen in Carthage;
pointing out how impossible it was, on any other theory except
that it belonged to Phalaris, to account for the presence in
Carthage of a bull of this peculiar character with a door between
his shoulders.&nbsp; But one of the great points which he uses
against this Sicilian historian is in reference to the question
of the origin of the Locrian colony.&nbsp; In accordance with the
received tradition on the subject, Aristotle had represented the
Locrian colony as founded by some Parthenid&aelig; or
slaves&rsquo; children, as they were called, a statement which
seems to have roused the indignation of Tim&aelig;us, who went to
a good deal of trouble to confute this theory.&nbsp; He does so
on the following grounds:&mdash;</p>
<p>First of all, he points out that in the ancient days the
Greeks had no slaves at all, so the mention of them in the matter
is an anachronism; and next he declares that he was shown in the
Greek city of Locris certain ancient inscriptions in which their
relation to the Italian city was expressed in terms of the
position between parent and child, which showed also that mutual
rights of citizenship were accorded to each city.&nbsp; Besides
this, he appeals to various questions of improbability as regards
their international relationship, on which Polybius takes
diametrically opposite grounds which hardly call for
discussion.&nbsp; And in favour of his own view he urges two
points more: first, that the Laced&aelig;monians being allowed
furlough for the purpose of seeing their wives at home, it was
unlikely that the Locrians should not have had the same
privilege; and next, that the Italian Locrians knew nothing of
the Aristotelian version and had, on the contrary, very severe
laws against adulterers, runaway slaves and the like.&nbsp; Now,
most of these questions rest on mere probability, which is always
such a subjective canon that an appeal to it is rarely
conclusive.&nbsp; I would note, however, as regards the
inscriptions which, if genuine, would of course have settled the
matter, that Polybius looks on them as a mere invention on the
part of Tim&aelig;us, who, he remarks, gives no details about
them, though, as a rule, he is over-anxious to give chapter and
verse for everything.&nbsp; A somewhat more interesting point is
that where he attacks Tim&aelig;us for the introduction of
fictitious speeches into his narrative; for on this point
Polybius seems to be far in advance of the opinions held by
literary men on the subject not merely in his own day, but for
centuries after.</p>
<p>Herodotus had introduced speeches avowedly dramatic and
fictitious.&nbsp; Thucydides states clearly that, where he was
unable to find out what people really said, he put down what they
ought to have said.&nbsp; Sallust alludes, it is true, to the
fact of the speech he puts into the mouth of the tribune Memmius
being essentially genuine, but the speeches given in the senate
on the occasion of the Catilinarian conspiracy are very different
from the same orations as they appear in Cicero.&nbsp; Livy makes
his ancient Romans wrangle and chop logic with all the subtlety
of a Hortensius or a Sc&aelig;vola.&nbsp; And even in later days,
when shorthand reporters attended the debates of the senate and a
<i>Daily News</i> was published in Rome, we find that one of the
most celebrated speeches in Tacitus (that in which the Emperor
Claudius gives the Gauls their freedom) is shown, by an
inscription discovered recently at Lugdunum, to be entirely
fabulous.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, it must be borne in mind that these
speeches were not intended to deceive; they were regarded merely
as a certain dramatic element which it was allowable to introduce
into history for the purpose of giving more life and reality to
the narration, and were to be criticised, not as we should, by
arguing how in an age before shorthand was known such a report
was possible or how, in the failure of written documents,
tradition could bring down such an accurate verbal account, but
by the higher test of their psychological probability as regards
the persons in whose mouths they are placed.&nbsp; An ancient
historian in answer to modern criticism would say, probably, that
these fictitious speeches were in reality more truthful than the
actual ones, just as Aristotle claimed for poetry a higher degree
of truth in comparison to history.&nbsp; The whole point is
interesting as showing how far in advance of his age Polybius may
be said to have been.</p>
<p>The last scientific historian, it is possible to gather from
his writings what he considered were the characteristics of the
ideal writer of history; and no small light will be thrown on the
progress of historical criticism if we strive to collect and
analyse what in Polybius are more or less scattered
expressions.&nbsp; The ideal historian must be contemporary with
the events he describes, or removed from them by one generation
only.&nbsp; Where it is possible, he is to be an eye-witness of
what he writes of; where that is out of his power he is to test
all traditions and stories carefully and not to be ready to
accept what is plausible in place of what is true.&nbsp; He is to
be no bookworm living aloof from the experiences of the world in
the artificial isolation of a university town, but a politician,
a soldier, and a traveller, a man not merely of thought but of
action, one who can do great things as well as write of them, who
in the sphere of history could be what Byron and &AElig;schylus
were in the sphere of poetry, at once <i>le chantre et le
h&eacute;ros</i>.</p>
<p>He is to keep before his eyes the fact that chance is merely a
synonym for our ignorance; that the reign of law pervades the
domain of history as much as it does that of political
science.&nbsp; He is to accustom himself to look on all occasions
for rational and natural causes.&nbsp; And while he is to
recognise the practical utility of the supernatural, in an
educational point of view, he is not himself to indulge in such
intellectual beating of the air as to admit the possibility of
the violation of inviolable laws, or to argue in a sphere wherein
argument is <i>a priori</i> annihilated.&nbsp; He is to be free
from all bias towards friend and country; he is to be courteous
and gentle in criticism; he is not to regard history as a mere
opportunity for splendid and tragic writing; nor is he to falsify
truth for the sake of a paradox or an epigram.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the importance of particular facts as
samples of higher truths, he is to take a broad and general view
of humanity.&nbsp; He is to deal with the whole race and with the
world, not with particular tribes or separate countries.&nbsp; He
is to bear in mind that the world is really an organism wherein
no one part can be moved without the others being affected
also.&nbsp; He is to distinguish between cause and occasion,
between the influence of general laws and particular fancies, and
he is to remember that the greatest lessons of the world are
contained in history and that it is the historian&rsquo;s duty to
manifest them so as to save nations from following those unwise
policies which always lead to dishonour and ruin, and to teach
individuals to apprehend by the intellectual culture of history
those truths which else they would have to learn in the bitter
school of experience.</p>
<p>Now, as regards his theory of the necessity of the
historian&rsquo;s being contemporary with the events he
describes, so far as the historian is a mere narrator the remark
is undoubtedly true.&nbsp; But to appreciate the harmony and
rational position of the facts of a great epoch, to discover its
laws, the causes which produced it and the effects which it
generates, the scene must be viewed from a certain height and
distance to be completely apprehended.&nbsp; A thoroughly
contemporary historian such as Lord Clarendon or Thucydides is in
reality part of the history he criticises; and, in the case of
such contemporary historians as Fabius and Philistus, Polybius in
compelled to acknowledge that they are misled by patriotic and
other considerations.&nbsp; Against Polybius himself no such
accusation can be made.&nbsp; He indeed of all men is able, as
from some lofty tower, to discern the whole tendency of the
ancient world, the triumph of Roman institutions and of Greek
thought which is the last message of the old world and, in a more
spiritual sense, has become the Gospel of the new.</p>
<p>One thing indeed he did not see, or if he saw it, he thought
but little of it&mdash;how from the East there was spreading over
the world, as a wave spreads, a spiritual inroad of new religions
from the time when the Pessinuntine mother of the gods, a
shapeless mass of stone, was brought to the eternal city by her
holiest citizen, to the day when the ship <i>Castor and
Pollux</i> stood in at Puteoli, and St. Paul turned his face
towards martyrdom and victory at Rome.&nbsp; Polybius was able to
predict, from his knowledge of the causes of revolutions and the
tendencies of the various forms of governments, the uprising of
that democratic tone of thought which, as soon as a seed is sown
in the murder of the Gracchi and the exile of Marius, culminated
as all democratic movements do culminate, in the supreme
authority of one man, the lordship of the world under the
world&rsquo;s rightful lord, Caius Julius C&aelig;sar.&nbsp;
This, indeed, he saw in no uncertain way.&nbsp; But the turning
of all men&rsquo;s hearts to the East, the first glimmering of
that splendid dawn which broke over the hills of Galilee and
flooded the earth like wine, was hidden from his eyes.</p>
<p>There are many points in the description of the ideal
historian which one may compare to the picture which Plato has
given us of the ideal philosopher.&nbsp; They are both
&lsquo;spectators of all time and all existence.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Nothing is contemptible in their eyes, for all things have a
meaning, and they both walk in august reasonableness before all
men, conscious of the workings of God yet free from all terror of
mendicant priest or vagrant miracle-worker.&nbsp; But the
parallel ends here.&nbsp; For the one stands aloof from the
world-storm of sleet and hail, his eyes fixed on distant and
sunlit heights, loving knowledge for the sake of knowledge and
wisdom for the joy of wisdom, while the other is an eager actor
in the world ever seeking to apply his knowledge to useful
things.&nbsp; Both equally desire truth, but the one because of
its utility, the other for its beauty.&nbsp; The historian
regards it as the rational principle of all true history, and no
more.&nbsp; To the other it comes as an all-pervading and mystic
enthusiasm, &lsquo;like the desire of strong wine, the craving of
ambition, the passionate love of what is beautiful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still, though we miss in the historian those higher and more
spiritual qualities which the philosopher of the Academe alone of
all men possessed, we must not blind ourselves to the merits of
that great rationalist who seems to have anticipated the very
latest words of modern science.&nbsp; Nor yet is he to be
regarded merely in the narrow light in which he is estimated by
most modern critics, as the explicit champion of rationalism and
nothing more.&nbsp; For he is connected with another idea, the
course of which is as the course of that great river of his
native Arcadia which, springing from some arid and sun-bleached
rock, gathers strength and beauty as it flows till it reaches the
asphodel meadows of Olympia and the light and laughter of Ionian
waters.</p>
<p>For in him we can discern the first notes of that great cult
of the seven-hilled city which made Virgil write his epic and
Livy his history, which found in Dante its highest exponent,
which dreamed of an Empire where the Emperor would care for the
bodies and the Pope for the souls of men, and so has passed into
the conception of God&rsquo;s spiritual empire and the universal
brotherhood of man and widened into the huge ocean of universal
thought as the Peneus loses itself in the sea.</p>
<p>Polybius is the last scientific historian of Greece.&nbsp; The
writer who seems fittingly to complete the progress of thought is
a writer of biographies only.&nbsp; I will not here touch on
Plutarch&rsquo;s employment of the inductive method as shown in
his constant use of inscription and statue, of public document
and building and the like, because it involves no new
method.&nbsp; It is his attitude towards miracles of which I
desire to treat.</p>
<p>Plutarch is philosophic enough to see that in the sense of a
violation of the laws of nature a miracle is impossible.&nbsp; It
is absurd, he says, to imagine that the statue of a saint can
speak, and that an inanimate object not possessing the vocal
organs should be able to utter an articulate sound.&nbsp; Upon
the other hand, he protests against science imagining that, by
explaining the natural causes of things, it has explained away
their transcendental meaning.&nbsp; &lsquo;When the tears on the
cheek of some holy statue have been analysed into the moisture
which certain temperatures produce on wood and marble, it yet by
no means follows that they were not a sign of grief and mourning
set there by God Himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; When Lampon saw in the
prodigy of the one-horned ram the omen of the supreme rule of
Pericles, and when Anaxagoras showed that the abnormal
development was the rational resultant of the peculiar formation
of the skull, the dreamer and the man of science were both right;
it was the business of the latter to consider how the prodigy
came about, of the former to show why it was so formed and what
it so portended.&nbsp; The progression of thought is exemplified
in all particulars.&nbsp; Herodotus had a glimmering sense of the
impossibility of a violation of nature.&nbsp; Thucydides ignored
the supernatural.&nbsp; Polybius rationalised it.&nbsp; Plutarch
raises it to its mystical heights again, though he bases it on
law.&nbsp; In a word, Plutarch felt that while science brings the
supernatural down to the natural, yet ultimately all that is
natural is really supernatural.&nbsp; To him, as to many of our
own day, religion was that transcendental attitude of the mind
which, contemplating a world resting on inviolable law, is yet
comforted and seeks to worship God not in the violation but in
the fulfilment of nature.</p>
<p>It may seem paradoxical to quote in connection with the priest
of Ch&aelig;ronea such a pure rationalist as Mr. Herbert Spencer;
yet when we read as the last message of modern science that
&lsquo;when the equation of life has been reduced to its lowest
terms the symbols are symbols still,&rsquo; mere signs, that is,
of that unknown reality which underlies all matter and all
spirit, we may feel how over the wide strait of centuries thought
calls to thought and how Plutarch has a higher position than is
usually claimed for him in the progress of the Greek
intellect.</p>
<p>And, indeed, it seems that not merely the importance of
Plutarch himself but also that of the land of his birth in the
evolution of Greek civilisation has been passed over by modern
critics.&nbsp; To us, indeed, the bare rock to which the
Parthenon serves as a crown, and which lies between Colonus and
Attica&rsquo;s violet hills, will always be the holiest spot in
the land of Greece: and Delphi will come next, and then the
meadows of Eurotas where that noble people lived who represented
in Hellenic thought the reaction of the law of duty against the
law of beauty, the opposition of conduct to culture.&nbsp; Yet,
as one stands on the <i>&sigma;&chi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#8052;
&#8001;&delta;&#972;&sigmaf;</i> of Cith&aelig;ron and looks out
on the great double plain of Boeotia, the enormous importance of
the division of Hellas comes to one&rsquo;s mind with great
force.&nbsp; To the north are Orchomenus and the Minyan
treasure-house, seat of those merchant princes of Phoenicia who
brought to Greece the knowledge of letters and the art of working
in gold.&nbsp; Thebes is at our feet with the gloom of the
terrible legends of Greek tragedy still lingering about it, the
birthplace of Pindar, the nurse of Epaminondas and the Sacred
Band.</p>
<p>And from out of the plain where &lsquo;Mars loved to
dance,&rsquo; rises the Muses&rsquo; haunt, Helicon, by whose
silver streams Corinna and Hesiod sang; while far away under the
white &aelig;gis of those snow-capped mountains lies
Ch&aelig;ronea and the Lion plain where with vain chivalry the
Greeks strove to check Macedon first and afterwards Rome;
Ch&aelig;ronea, where in the Martinmas summer of Greek
civilisation Plutarch rose from the drear waste of a dying
religion as the aftermath rises when the mowers think they have
left the field bare.</p>
<p>Greek philosophy began and ended in scepticism: the first and
the last word of Greek history was Faith.</p>
<p>Splendid thus in its death, like winter sunsets, the Greek
religion passed away into the horror of night.&nbsp; For the
Cimmerian darkness was at hand, and when the schools of Athens
were closed and the statue of Athena broken, the Greek spirit
passed from the gods and the history of its own land to the
subtleties of defining the doctrine of the Trinity and the
mystical attempts to bring Plato into harmony with Christ and to
reconcile Gethsemane and the Sermon on the Mount with the
Athenian prison and the discussion in the woods of Colonus.&nbsp;
The Greek spirit slept for wellnigh a thousand years.&nbsp; When
it woke again, like Ant&aelig;us it had gathered strength from
the earth where it lay; like Apollo it had lost none of its
divinity through its long servitude.</p>
<p>In the history of Roman thought we nowhere find any of those
characteristics of the Greek Illumination which I have pointed
out are the necessary concomitants of the rise of historical
criticism.&nbsp; The conservative respect for tradition which
made the Roman people delight in the ritual and formulas of law,
and is as apparent in their politics as in their religion, was
fatal to any rise of that spirit of revolt against authority the
importance of which, as a factor in intellectual progress, we
have already seen.</p>
<p>The whitened tables of the Pontifices preserved carefully the
records of the eclipses and other atmospherical phenomena, and
what we call the art of verifying dates was known to them at an
early time; but there was no spontaneous rise of physical science
to suggest by its analogies of law and order a new method of
research, nor any natural springing up of the questioning spirit
of philosophy with its unification of all phenomena and all
knowledge.&nbsp; At the very time when the whole tide of Eastern
superstition was sweeping into the heart of the Capital the
Senate banished the Greek philosophers from Rome.&nbsp; And of
the three systems which did at length take some root in the city,
those of Zeno and Epicurus were used merely as the rule for the
ordering of life, while the dogmatic scepticism of Carneades, by
its very principles, annihilated the possibility of argument and
encouraged a perfect indifference to research.</p>
<p>Nor were the Romans ever fortunate enough like the Greeks to
have to face the incubus of any dogmatic system of legends and
myths, the immoralities and absurdities of which might excite a
revolutionary outbreak of sceptical criticism.&nbsp; For the
Roman religion became as it were crystallised and isolated from
progress at an early period of its evolution.&nbsp; Their gods
remained mere abstractions of commonplace virtues or
uninteresting personifications of the useful things of
life.&nbsp; The old primitive creed was indeed always upheld as a
state institution on account of the enormous facilities it
offered for cheating in politics, but as a spiritual system of
belief it was unanimously rejected at a very early period both by
the common people and the educated classes, for the sensible
reason that it was so extremely dull.&nbsp; The former took
refuge in the mystic sensualities of the worship of Isis, the
latter in the Stoical rules of life.&nbsp; The Romans classified
their gods carefully in their order of precedence, analysed their
genealogies in the laborious spirit of modern heraldry, fenced
them round with a ritual as intricate as their law, but never
quite cared enough about them to believe in them.&nbsp; So it was
of no account with them when the philosophers announced that
Minerva was merely memory.&nbsp; She had never been much
else.&nbsp; Nor did they protest when Lucretius dared to say of
Ceres and of Liber that they were only the corn of the field and
the fruit of the vine.&nbsp; For they had never mourned for the
daughter of Demeter in the asphodel meadows of Sicily, nor
traversed the glades of Cith&aelig;ron with fawn-skin and with
spear.</p>
<p>This brief sketch of the condition of Roman thought will serve
to prepare us for the almost total want of scientific historical
criticism which we shall discern in their literature, and has,
besides, afforded fresh corroboration of the conditions essential
to the rise of this spirit, and of the modes of thought which it
reflects and in which it is always to be found.&nbsp; Roman
historical composition had its origin in the pontifical college
of ecclesiastical lawyers, and preserved to its close the
uncritical spirit which characterised its fountain-head.&nbsp; It
possessed from the outset a most voluminous collection of the
materials of history, which, however, produced merely
antiquarians, not historians.&nbsp; It is so hard to use facts,
so easy to accumulate them.</p>
<p>Wearied of the dull monotony of the pontifical annals, which
dwelt on little else but the rise and fall in provisions and the
eclipses of the sun, Cato wrote out a history with his own hand
for the instruction of his child, to which he gave the name of
Origines, and before his time some aristocratic families had
written histories in Greek much in the same spirit in which the
Germans of the eighteenth century used French as the literary
language.&nbsp; But the first regular Roman historian is
Sallust.&nbsp; Between the extravagant eulogies passed on this
author by the French (such as De Closset), and Dr.
Mommsen&rsquo;s view of him as merely a political pamphleteer, it
is perhaps difficult to reach the <i>via media</i> of unbiassed
appreciation.&nbsp; He has, at any rate, the credit of being a
purely rationalistic historian, perhaps the only one in Roman
literature.&nbsp; Cicero had a good many qualifications for a
scientific historian, and (as he usually did) thought very highly
of his own powers.&nbsp; On passages of ancient legend, however,
he is rather unsatisfactory, for while he is too sensible to
believe them he is too patriotic to reject them.&nbsp; And this
is really the attitude of Livy, who claims for early Roman legend
a certain uncritical homage from the rest of the subject
world.&nbsp; His view in his history is that it is not worth
while to examine the truth of these stories.</p>
<p>In his hands the history of Rome unrolls before our eyes like
some gorgeous tapestry, where victory succeeds victory, where
triumph treads on the heels of triumph, and the line of heroes
seems never to end.&nbsp; It is not till we pass behind the
canvas and see the slight means by which the effect is produced
that we apprehend the fact that like most picturesque writers
Livy is an indifferent critic.&nbsp; As regards his attitude
towards the credibility of early Roman history he is quite as
conscious as we are of its mythical and unsound nature.&nbsp; He
will not, for instance, decide whether the Horatii were Albans or
Romans; who was the first dictator; how many tribunes there were,
and the like.&nbsp; His method, as a rule, is merely to mention
all the accounts and sometimes to decide in favour of the most
probable, but usually not to decide at all.&nbsp; No canons of
historical criticism will ever discover whether the Roman women
interviewed the mother of Coriolanus of their own accord or at
the suggestion of the senate; whether Remus was killed for
jumping over his brother&rsquo;s wall or because they quarrelled
about birds; whether the ambassadors found Cincinnatus ploughing
or only mending a hedge.&nbsp; Livy suspends his judgment over
these important facts and history when questioned on their truth
is dumb.&nbsp; If he does select between two historians he
chooses the one who is nearer to the facts he describes.&nbsp;
But he is no critic, only a conscientious writer.&nbsp; It is
mere vain waste to dwell on his critical powers, for they do not
exist.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the case of Tacitus imagination has taken the place of
history.&nbsp; The past lives again in his pages, but through no
laborious criticism; rather through a dramatic and psychological
faculty which he specially possessed.</p>
<p>In the philosophy of history he has no belief.&nbsp; He can
never make up his mind what to believe as regards God&rsquo;s
government of the world.&nbsp; There is no method in him and none
elsewhere in Roman literature.</p>
<p>Nations may not have missions but they certainly have
functions.&nbsp; And the function of ancient Italy was not merely
to give us what is statical in our institutions and rational in
our law, but to blend into one elemental creed the spiritual
aspirations of Aryan and of Semite.&nbsp; Italy was not a pioneer
in intellectual progress, nor a motive power in the evolution of
thought.&nbsp; The owl of the goddess of Wisdom traversed over
the whole land and found nowhere a resting-place.&nbsp; The dove,
which is the bird of Christ, flew straight to the city of Rome
and the new reign began.&nbsp; It was the fashion of early
Italian painters to represent in medi&aelig;val costume the
soldiers who watched over the tomb of Christ, and this, which was
the result of the frank anachronism of all true art, may serve to
us as an allegory.&nbsp; For it was in vain that the Middle Ages
strove to guard the buried spirit of progress.&nbsp; When the
dawn of the Greek spirit arose, the sepulchre was empty, the
grave-clothes laid aside.&nbsp; Humanity had risen from the
dead.</p>
<p>The study of Greek, it has been well said, implies the birth
of criticism, comparison and research.&nbsp; At the opening of
that education of modern by ancient thought which we call the
Renaissance, it was the words of Aristotle which sent Columbus
sailing to the New World, while a fragment of Pythagorean
astronomy set Copernicus thinking on that train of reasoning
which has revolutionised the whole position of our planet in the
universe.&nbsp; Then it was seen that the only meaning of
progress is a return to Greek modes of thought.&nbsp; The monkish
hymns which obscured the pages of Greek manuscripts were blotted
out, the splendours of a new method were unfolded to the world,
and out of the melancholy sea of medi&aelig;valism rose the free
spirit of man in all that splendour of glad adolescence, when the
bodily powers seem quickened by a new vitality, when the eye sees
more clearly than its wont and the mind apprehends what was
beforetime hidden from it.&nbsp; To herald the opening of the
sixteenth century, from the little Venetian printing press came
forth all the great authors of antiquity, each bearing on the
title-page the words <i>&#7949;&lambda;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&#8001;
&Mu;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&#973;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&#8172;&omega;&mu;&alpha;&#8150;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&Phi;&iota;&lambda;&#941;&lambda;&lambda;&eta;&nu;</i>; words
which may serve to remind us with what wondrous prescience
Polybius saw the world&rsquo;s fate when he foretold the material
sovereignty of Roman institutions and exemplified in himself the
intellectual empire of Greece.</p>
<p>The course of the study of the spirit of historical criticism
has not been a profitless investigation into modes and forms of
thought now antiquated and of no account.&nbsp; The only spirit
which is entirely removed from us is the medi&aelig;val; the
Greek spirit is essentially modern.&nbsp; The introduction of the
comparative method of research which has forced history to
disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us.&nbsp; Ours, too,
is a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of
survival.&nbsp; Nor did the ancients know anything of the
doctrine of averages or of crucial instances, both of which
methods have proved of such importance in modern criticism, the
one adding a most important proof of the statical elements of
history, and exemplifying the influences of all physical
surroundings on the life of man; the other, as in the single
instance of the Moulin Quignon skull, serving to create a whole
new science of prehistoric arch&aelig;ology and to bring us back
to a time when man was coeval with the stone age, the mammoth and
the woolly rhinoceros.&nbsp; But, except these, we have added no
new canon or method to the science of historical criticism.&nbsp;
Across the drear waste of a thousand years the Greek and the
modern spirit join hands.</p>
<p>In the torch race which the Greek boys ran from the
Cerameician field of death to the home of the goddess of Wisdom,
not merely he who first reached the goal but he also who first
started with the torch aflame received a prize.&nbsp; In the
Lampadephoria of civilisation and free thought let us not forget
to render due meed of honour to those who first lit that sacred
flame, the increasing splendour of which lights our footsteps to
the far-off divine event of the attainment of perfect truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many debts which we owe
to the supreme &aelig;sthetic faculty of Goethe is that he was
the first to teach us to define beauty in terms the most concrete
possible, to realise it, I mean, always in its special
manifestations.&nbsp; So, in the lecture which I have the honour
to deliver before you, I will not try to give you any abstract
definition of beauty&mdash;any such universal formula for it as
was sought for by the philosophy of the eighteenth
century&mdash;still less to communicate to you that which in its
essence is incommunicable, the virtue by which a particular
picture or poem affects us with a unique and special joy; but
rather to point out to you the general ideas which characterise
the great English Renaissance of Art in this century, to discover
their source, as far as that is possible, and to estimate their
future as far as that is possible.</p>
<p>I call it our English Renaissance because it is indeed a sort
of new birth of the spirit of man, like the great Italian
Renaissance of the fifteenth century, in its desire for a more
gracious and comely way of life, its passion for physical beauty,
its exclusive attention to form, its seeking for new subjects for
poetry, new forms of art, new intellectual and imaginative
enjoyments: and I call it our romantic movement because it is our
most recent expression of beauty.</p>
<p>It has been described as a mere revival of Greek modes of
thought, and again as a mere revival of medi&aelig;val
feeling.&nbsp; Rather I would say that to these forms of the
human spirit it has added whatever of artistic value the
intricacy and complexity and experience of modern life can give:
taking from the one its clearness of vision and its sustained
calm, from the other its variety of expression and the mystery of
its vision.&nbsp; For what, as Goethe said, is the study of the
ancients but a return to the real world (for that is what they
did); and what, said Mazzini, is medi&aelig;valism but
individuality?</p>
<p>It is really from the union of Hellenism, in its breadth, its
sanity of purpose, its calm possession of beauty, with the
adventive, the intensified individualism, the passionate colour
of the romantic spirit, that springs the art of the nineteenth
century in England, as from the marriage of Faust and Helen of
Troy sprang the beautiful boy Euphorion.</p>
<p>Such expressions as &lsquo;classical&rsquo; and
&lsquo;romantic&rsquo; are, it is true, often apt to become the
mere catchwords of schools.&nbsp; We must always remember that
art has only one sentence to utter: there is for her only one
high law, the law of form or harmony&mdash;yet between the
classical and romantic spirit we may say that there lies this
difference at least, that the one deals with the type and the
other with the exception.&nbsp; In the work produced under the
modern romantic spirit it is no longer the permanent, the
essential truths of life that are treated of; it is the momentary
situation of the one, the momentary aspect of the other that art
seeks to render.&nbsp; In sculpture, which is the type of one
spirit, the subject predominates over the situation; in painting,
which is the type of the other, the situation predominates over
the subject.</p>
<p>There are two spirits, then: the Hellenic spirit and the
spirit of romance may be taken as forming the essential elements
of our conscious intellectual tradition, of our permanent
standard of taste.&nbsp; As regards their origin, in art as in
politics there is but one origin for all revolutions, a desire on
the part of man for a nobler form of life, for a freer method and
opportunity of expression.&nbsp; Yet, I think that in estimating
the sensuous and intellectual spirit which presides over our
English Renaissance, any attempt to isolate it in any way from in
the progress and movement and social life of the age that has
produced it would be to rob it of its true vitality, possibly to
mistake its true meaning.&nbsp; And in disengaging from the
pursuits and passions of this crowded modern world those passions
and pursuits which have to do with art and the love of art, we
must take into account many great events of history which seem to
be the most opposed to any such artistic feeling.</p>
<p>Alien then from any wild, political passion, or from the harsh
voice of a rude people in revolt, as our English Renaissance must
seem, in its passionate cult of pure beauty, its flawless
devotion to form, its exclusive and sensitive nature, it is to
the French Revolution that we must look for the most primary
factor of its production, the first condition of its birth: that
great Revolution of which we are all the children though the
voices of some of us be often loud against it; that Revolution to
which at a time when even such spirits as Coleridge and
Wordsworth lost heart in England, noble messages of love blown
across seas came from your young Republic.</p>
<p>It is true that our modern sense of the continuity of history
has shown us that neither in politics nor in nature are there
revolutions ever but evolutions only, and that the prelude to
that wild storm which swept over France in 1789 and made every
king in Europe tremble for his throne, was first sounded in
literature years before the Bastille fell and the Palace was
taken.&nbsp; The way for those red scenes by Seine and Loire was
paved by that critical spirit of Germany and England which
accustomed men to bring all things to the test of reason or
utility or both, while the discontent of the people in the
streets of Paris was the echo that followed the life of Emile and
of Werther.&nbsp; For Rousseau, by silent lake and mountain, had
called humanity back to the golden age that still lies before us
and preached a return to nature, in passionate eloquence whose
music still lingers about our keen northern air.&nbsp; And Goethe
and Scott had brought romance back again from the prison she had
lain in for so many centuries&mdash;and what is romance but
humanity?</p>
<p>Yet in the womb of the Revolution itself, and in the storm and
terror of that wild time, tendencies were hidden away that the
artistic Renaissance bent to her own service when the time
came&mdash;a scientific tendency first, which has borne in our
own day a brood of somewhat noisy Titans, yet in the sphere of
poetry has not been unproductive of good.&nbsp; I do not mean
merely in its adding to enthusiasm that intellectual basis which
in its strength, or that more obvious influence about which
Wordsworth was thinking when he said very nobly that poetry was
merely the impassioned expression in the face of science, and
that when science would put on a form of flesh and blood the poet
would lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration.&nbsp;
Nor do I dwell much on the great cosmical emotion and deep
pantheism of science to which Shelley has given its first and
Swinburne its latest glory of song, but rather on its influence
on the artistic spirit in preserving that close observation and
the sense of limitation as well as of clearness of vision which
are the characteristics of the real artist.</p>
<p>The great and golden rule of art as well as of life, wrote
William Blake, is that the more distinct, sharp and defined the
boundary line, the more perfect is the work of art; and the less
keen and sharp the greater is the evidence of weak imitation,
plagiarism and bungling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Great inventors in all ages
knew this&mdash;Michael Angelo and Albert Durer are known by this
and by this alone&rsquo;; and another time he wrote, with all the
simple directness of nineteenth-century prose, &lsquo;to
generalise is to be an idiot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And this love of definite conception, this clearness of
vision, this artistic sense of limit, is the characteristic of
all great work and poetry; of the vision of Homer as of the
vision of Dante, of Keats and William Morris as of Chaucer and
Theocritus.&nbsp; It lies at the base of all noble, realistic and
romantic work as opposed to the colourless and empty abstractions
of our own eighteenth-century poets and of the classical
dramatists of France, or of the vague spiritualities of the
German sentimental school: opposed, too, to that spirit of
transcendentalism which also was root and flower itself of the
great Revolution, underlying the impassioned contemplation of
Wordsworth and giving wings and fire to the eagle-like flight of
Shelley, and which in the sphere of philosophy, though displaced
by the materialism and positiveness of our day, bequeathed two
great schools of thought, the school of Newman to Oxford, the
school of Emerson to America.&nbsp; Yet is this spirit of
transcendentalism alien to the spirit of art.&nbsp; For the
artist can accept no sphere of life in exchange for life
itself.&nbsp; For him there is no escape from the bondage of the
earth: there is not even the desire of escape.</p>
<p>He is indeed the only true realist: symbolism, which is the
essence of the transcendental spirit, is alien to him.&nbsp; The
metaphysical mind of Asia will create for itself the monstrous,
many-breasted idol of Ephesus, but to the Greek, pure artist,
that work is most instinct with spiritual life which conforms
most clearly to the perfect facts of physical life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The storm of revolution,&rsquo; as Andre Chenier said,
&lsquo;blows out the torch of poetry.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is not for
some little time that the real influence of such a wild cataclysm
of things is felt: at first the desire for equality seems to have
produced personalities of more giant and Titan stature than the
world had ever known before.&nbsp; Men heard the lyre of Byron
and the legions of Napoleon; it was a period of measureless
passions and of measureless despair; ambition, discontent, were
the chords of life and art; the age was an age of revolt: a phase
through which the human spirit must pass, but one in which it
cannot rest.&nbsp; For the aim of culture is not rebellion but
peace, the valley perilous where ignorant armies clash by night
being no dwelling-place meet for her to whom the gods have
assigned the fresh uplands and sunny heights and clear,
untroubled air.</p>
<p>And soon that desire for perfection, which lay at the base of
the Revolution, found in a young English poet its most complete
and flawless realisation.</p>
<p>Phidias and the achievements of Greek art are foreshadowed in
Homer: Dante prefigures for us the passion and colour and
intensity of Italian painting: the modern love of landscape dates
from Rousseau, and it is in Keats that one discerns the beginning
of the artistic renaissance of England.</p>
<p>Byron was a rebel and Shelley a dreamer; but in the calmness
and clearness of his vision, his perfect self-control, his
unerring sense of beauty and his recognition of a separate realm
for the imagination, Keats was the pure and serene artist, the
forerunner of the pre-Raphaelite school, and so of the great
romantic movement of which I am to speak.</p>
<p>Blake had indeed, before him, claimed for art a lofty,
spiritual mission, and had striven to raise design to the ideal
level of poetry and music, but the remoteness of his vision both
in painting and poetry and the incompleteness of his technical
powers had been adverse to any real influence.&nbsp; It is in
Keats that the artistic spirit of this century first found its
absolute incarnation.</p>
<p>And these pre-Raphaelites, what were they?&nbsp; If you ask
nine-tenths of the British public what is the meaning of the word
&aelig;sthetics, they will tell you it is the French for
affectation or the German for a dado; and if you inquire about
the pre-Raphaelites you will hear something about an eccentric
lot of young men to whom a sort of divine crookedness and holy
awkwardness in drawing were the chief objects of art.&nbsp; To
know nothing about their great men is one of the necessary
elements of English education.</p>
<p>As regards the pre-Raphaelites the story is simple
enough.&nbsp; In the year 1847 a number of young men in London,
poets and painters, passionate admirers of Keats all of them,
formed the habit of meeting together for discussions on art, the
result of such discussions being that the English Philistine
public was roused suddenly from its ordinary apathy by hearing
that there was in its midst a body of young men who had
determined to revolutionise English painting and poetry.&nbsp;
They called themselves the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.</p>
<p>In England, then as now, it was enough for a man to try and
produce any serious beautiful work to lose all his rights as a
citizen; and besides this, the pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood&mdash;among whom the names of Dante Rossetti, Holman
Hunt and Millais will be familiar to you&mdash;had on their side
three things that the English public never forgives: youth, power
and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Satire, always as sterile as it in shameful and as impotent as
it is insolent, paid them that usual homage which mediocrity pays
to genius&mdash;doing, here as always, infinite harm to the
public, blinding them to what is beautiful, teaching them that
irreverence which is the source of all vileness and narrowness of
life, but harming the artist not at all, rather confirming him in
the perfect rightness of his work and ambition.&nbsp; For to
disagree with three-fourths of the British public on all points
is one of the first elements of sanity, one of the deepest
consolations in all moments of spiritual doubt.</p>
<p>As regards the ideas these young men brought to the
regeneration of English art, we may see at the base of their
artistic creations a desire for a deeper spiritual value to be
given to art as well as a more decorative value.</p>
<p>Pre-Raphaelites they called themselves; not that they imitated
the early Italian masters at all, but that in their work, as
opposed to the facile abstractions of Raphael, they found a
stronger realism of imagination, a more careful realism of
technique, a vision at once more fervent and more vivid, an
individuality more intimate and more intense.</p>
<p>For it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the
&aelig;sthetic demands of its age: there must be also about it,
if it is to affect us with any permanent delight, the impress of
a distinct individuality, an individuality remote from that of
ordinary men, and coming near to us only by virtue of a certain
newness and wonder in the work, and through channels whose very
strangeness makes us more ready to give them welcome.</p>
<p><i>La personnalit&eacute;</i>, said one of the greatest of
modern French critics, <i>voil&agrave; ce qui nous
sauvera</i>.</p>
<p>But above all things was it a return to Nature&mdash;that
formula which seems to suit so many and such diverse movements:
they would draw and paint nothing but what they saw, they would
try and imagine things as they really happened.&nbsp; Later there
came to the old house by Blackfriars Bridge, where this young
brotherhood used to meet and work, two young men from Oxford,
Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris&mdash;the latter
substituting for the simpler realism of the early days a more
exquisite spirit of choice, a more faultless devotion to beauty,
a more intense seeking for perfection: a master of all exquisite
design and of all spiritual vision.&nbsp; It is of the school of
Florence rather than of that of Venice that he is kinsman,
feeling that the close imitation of Nature is a disturbing
element in imaginative art.&nbsp; The visible aspect of modern
life disturbs him not; rather is it for him to render eternal all
that is beautiful in Greek, Italian, and Celtic legend.&nbsp; To
Morris we owe poetry whose perfect precision and clearness of
word and vision has not been excelled in the literature of our
country, and by the revival of the decorative arts he has given
to our individualised romantic movement the social idea and the
social factor also.</p>
<p>But the revolution accomplished by this clique of young men,
with Ruskin&rsquo;s faultless and fervent eloquence to help them,
was not one of ideas merely but of execution, not one of
conceptions but of creations.</p>
<p>For the great eras in the history of the development of all
the arts have been eras not of increased feeling or enthusiasm in
feeling for art, but of new technical improvements primarily and
specially.&nbsp; The discovery of marble quarries in the purple
ravines of Pentelicus and on the little low-lying hills of the
island of Paros gave to the Greeks the opportunity for that
intensified vitality of action, that more sensuous and simple
humanism, to which the Egyptian sculptor working laboriously in
the hard porphyry and rose-coloured granite of the desert could
not attain.&nbsp; The splendour of the Venetian school began with
the introduction of the new oil medium for painting.&nbsp; The
progress in modern music has been due to the invention of new
instruments entirely, and in no way to an increased consciousness
on the part of the musician of any wider social aim.&nbsp; The
critic may try and trace the deferred resolutions of Beethoven <a
name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124"
class="citation">[124]</a> to some sense of the incompleteness of
the modern intellectual spirit, but the artist would have
answered, as one of them did afterwards, &lsquo;Let them pick out
the fifths and leave us at peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so it is in poetry also: all this love of curious French
metres like the Ballade, the Villanelle, the Rondel; all this
increased value laid on elaborate alliterations, and on curious
words and refrains, such as you will find in Dante Rossetti and
Swinburne, is merely the attempt to perfect flute and viol and
trumpet through which the spirit of the age and the lips of the
poet may blow the music of their many messages.</p>
<p>And so it has been with this romantic movement of ours: it is
a reaction against the empty conventional workmanship, the lax
execution of previous poetry and painting, showing itself in the
work of such men as Rossetti and Burne-Jones by a far greater
splendour of colour, a far more intricate wonder of design than
English imaginative art has shown before.&nbsp; In
Rossetti&rsquo;s poetry and the poetry of Morris, Swinburne and
Tennyson a perfect precision and choice of language, a style
flawless and fearless, a seeking for all sweet and precious
melodies and a sustaining consciousness of the musical value of
each word are opposed to that value which is merely
intellectual.&nbsp; In this respect they are one with the
romantic movement of France of which not the least characteristic
note was struck by Th&eacute;ophile Gautier&rsquo;s advice to the
young poet to read his dictionary every day, as being the only
book worth a poet&rsquo;s reading.</p>
<p>While, then, the material of workmanship is being thus
elaborated and discovered to have in itself incommunicable and
eternal qualities of its own, qualities entirely satisfying to
the poetic sense and not needing for their &aelig;sthetic effect
any lofty intellectual vision, any deep criticism of life or even
any passionate human emotion at all, the spirit and the method of
the poet&rsquo;s working&mdash;what people call his
inspiration&mdash;have not escaped the controlling influence of
the artistic spirit.&nbsp; Not that the imagination has lost its
wings, but we have accustomed ourselves to count their
innumerable pulsations, to estimate their limitless strength, to
govern their ungovernable freedom.</p>
<p>To the Greeks this problem of the conditions of poetic
production, and the places occupied by either spontaneity or
self-consciousness in any artistic work, had a peculiar
fascination.&nbsp; We find it in the mysticism of Plato and in
the rationalism of Aristotle.&nbsp; We find it later in the
Italian Renaissance agitating the minds of such men as Leonardo
da Vinci.&nbsp; Schiller tried to adjust the balance between form
and feeling, and Goethe to estimate the position of
self-consciousness in art.&nbsp; Wordsworth&rsquo;s definition of
poetry as &lsquo;emotion remembered in tranquillity&rsquo; may be
taken as an analysis of one of the stages through which all
imaginative work has to pass; and in Keats&rsquo;s longing to be
&lsquo;able to compose without this fever&rsquo; (I quote from
one of his letters), his desire to substitute for poetic ardour
&lsquo;a more thoughtful and quiet power,&rsquo; we may discern
the most important moment in the evolution of that artistic
life.&nbsp; The question made an early and strange appearance in
your literature too; and I need not remind you how deeply the
young poets of the French romantic movement were excited and
stirred by Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s analysis of the workings of
his own imagination in the creating of that supreme imaginative
work which we know by the name of <i>The Raven</i>.</p>
<p>In the last century, when the intellectual and didactic
element had intruded to such an extent into the kingdom which
belongs to poetry, it was against the claims of the understanding
that an artist like Goethe had to protest.&nbsp; &lsquo;The more
incomprehensible to the understanding a poem is the better for
it,&rsquo; he said once, asserting the complete supremacy of the
imagination in poetry as of reason in prose.&nbsp; But in this
century it is rather against the claims of the emotional
faculties, the claims of mere sentiment and feeling, that the
artist must react.&nbsp; The simple utterance of joy is not
poetry any more than a mere personal cry of pain, and the real
experiences of the artist are always those which do not find
their direct expression but are gathered up and absorbed into
some artistic form which seems, from such real experiences, to be
the farthest removed and the most alien.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The heart contains passion but the imagination alone
contains poetry,&rsquo; says Charles Baudelaire.&nbsp; This too
was the lesson that Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, most subtle of all
modern critics, most fascinating of all modern poets, was never
tired of teaching&mdash;&lsquo;Everybody is affected by a sunrise
or a sunset.&rsquo;&nbsp; The absolute distinction of the artist
is not his capacity to feel nature so much as his power of
rendering it.&nbsp; The entire subordination of all intellectual
and emotional faculties to the vital and informing poetic
principle is the surest sign of the strength of our
Renaissance.</p>
<p>We have seen the artistic spirit working, first in the
delightful and technical sphere of language, the sphere of
expression as opposed to subject, then controlling the
imagination of the poet in dealing with his subject.&nbsp; And
now I would point out to you its operation in the choice of
subject.&nbsp; The recognition of a separate realm for the
artist, a consciousness of the absolute difference between the
world of art and the world of real fact, between classic grace
and absolute reality, forms not merely the essential element of
any &aelig;sthetic charm but is the characteristic of all great
imaginative work and of all great eras of artistic
creation&mdash;of the age of Phidias as of the age of Michael
Angelo, of the age of Sophocles as of the age of Goethe.</p>
<p>Art never harms itself by keeping aloof from the social
problems of the day: rather, by so doing, it more completely
realises for us that which we desire.&nbsp; For to most of us the
real life is the life we do not lead, and thus, remaining more
true to the essence of its own perfection, more jealous of its
own unattainable beauty, is less likely to forget form in feeling
or to accept the passion of creation as any substitute for the
beauty of the created thing.</p>
<p>The artist is indeed the child of his own age, but the present
will not be to him a whit more real than the past; for, like the
philosopher of the Platonic vision, the poet is the spectator of
all time and of all existence.&nbsp; For him no form is obsolete,
no subject out of date; rather, whatever of life and passion the
world has known, in desert of Jud&aelig;a or in Arcadian valley,
by the rivers of Troy or the rivers of Damascus, in the crowded
and hideous streets of a modern city or by the pleasant ways of
Camelot&mdash;all lies before him like an open scroll, all is
still instinct with beautiful life.&nbsp; He will take of it what
is salutary for his own spirit, no more; choosing some facts and
rejecting others with the calm artistic control of one who is in
possession of the secret of beauty.</p>
<p>There is indeed a poetical attitude to be adopted towards all
things, but all things are not fit subjects for poetry.&nbsp;
Into the secure and sacred house of Beauty the true artist will
admit nothing that is harsh or disturbing, nothing that gives
pain, nothing that is debatable, nothing about which men
argue.&nbsp; He can steep himself, if he wishes, in the
discussion of all the social problems of his day, poor-laws and
local taxation, free trade and bimetallic currency, and the like;
but when he writes on these subjects it will be, as Milton nobly
expressed it, with his left hand, in prose and not in verse, in a
pamphlet and not in a lyric.&nbsp; This exquisite spirit of
artistic choice was not in Byron: Wordsworth had it not.&nbsp; In
the work of both these men there is much that we have to reject,
much that does not give us that sense of calm and perfect repose
which should be the effect of all fine, imaginative work.&nbsp;
But in Keats it seemed to have been incarnate, and in his lovely
<i>Ode on a Grecian Urn</i> it found its most secure and
faultless expression; in the pageant of the <i>Earthly
Paradise</i> and the knights and ladies of Burne-Jones it is the
one dominant note.</p>
<p>It is to no avail that the Muse of Poetry be called, even by
such a clarion note as Whitman&rsquo;s, to migrate from Greece
and Ionia and to placard <span class="GutSmall">REMOVED</span>
and <span class="GutSmall">TO LET</span> on the rocks of the
snowy Parnassus.&nbsp; Calliope&rsquo;s call is not yet closed,
nor are the epics of Asia ended; the Sphinx is not yet silent,
nor the fountain of Castaly dry.&nbsp; For art is very life
itself and knows nothing of death; she is absolute truth and
takes no care of fact; she sees (as I remember Mr. Swinburne
insisting on at dinner) that Achilles is even now more actual and
real than Wellington, not merely more noble and interesting as a
type and figure but more positive and real.</p>
<p>Literature must rest always on a principle, and temporal
considerations are no principle at all.&nbsp; For to the poet all
times and places are one; the stuff he deals with is eternal and
eternally the same: no theme is inept, no past or present
preferable.&nbsp; The steam whistle will not affright him nor the
flutes of Arcadia weary him: for him there is but one time, the
artistic moment; but one law, the law of form; but one land, the
land of Beauty&mdash;a land removed indeed from the real world
and yet more sensuous because more enduring; calm, yet with that
calm which dwells in the faces of the Greek statues, the calm
which comes not from the rejection but from the absorption of
passion, the calm which despair and sorrow cannot disturb but
intensify only.&nbsp; And so it comes that he who seems to stand
most remote from his age is he who mirrors it best, because he
has stripped life of what is accidental and transitory, stripped
it of that &lsquo;mist of familiarity which makes life obscure to
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those strange, wild-eyed sibyls fixed eternally in the
whirlwind of ecstasy, those mighty-limbed and Titan prophets,
labouring with the secret of the earth and the burden of mystery,
that guard and glorify the chapel of Pope Sixtus at Rome&mdash;do
they not tell us more of the real spirit of the Italian
Renaissance, of the dream of Savonarola and of the sin of Borgia,
than all the brawling boors and cooking women of Dutch art can
teach us of the real spirit of the history of Holland?</p>
<p>And so in our own day, also, the two most vital tendencies of
the nineteenth century&mdash;the democratic and pantheistic
tendency and the tendency to value life for the sake of
art&mdash;found their most complete and perfect utterance in the
poetry of Shelley and Keats who, to the blind eyes of their own
time, seemed to be as wanderers in the wilderness, preachers of
vague or unreal things.&nbsp; And I remember once, in talking to
Mr. Burne-Jones about modern science, his saying to me,
&lsquo;the more materialistic science becomes, the more angels
shall I paint: their wings are my protest in favour of the
immortality of the soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But these are the intellectual speculations that underlie
art.&nbsp; Where in the arts themselves are we to find that
breadth of human sympathy which is the condition of all noble
work; where in the arts are we to look for what Mazzini would
call the social ideas as opposed to the merely personal
ideas?&nbsp; By virtue of what claim do I demand for the artist
the love and loyalty of the men and women of the world?&nbsp; I
think I can answer that.</p>
<p>Whatever spiritual message an artist brings to his aid is a
matter for his own soul.&nbsp; He may bring judgment like Michael
Angelo or peace like Angelico; he may come with mourning like the
great Athenian or with mirth like the singer of Sicily; nor is it
for us to do aught but accept his teaching, knowing that we
cannot smite the bitter lips of Leopardi into laughter or burden
with our discontent Goethe&rsquo;s serene calm.&nbsp; But for
warrant of its truth such message must have the flame of
eloquence in the lips that speak it, splendour and glory in the
vision that is its witness, being justified by one thing
only&mdash;the flawless beauty and perfect form of its
expression: this indeed being the social idea, being the meaning
of joy in art.</p>
<p>Not laughter where none should laugh, nor the calling of peace
where there is no peace; not in painting the subject ever, but
the pictorial charm only, the wonder of its colour, the
satisfying beauty of its design.</p>
<p>You have most of you seen, probably, that great masterpiece of
Rubens which hangs in the gallery of Brussels, that swift and
wonderful pageant of horse and rider arrested in its most
exquisite and fiery moment when the winds are caught in crimson
banner and the air lit by the gleam of armour and the flash of
plume.&nbsp; Well, that is joy in art, though that golden
hillside be trodden by the wounded feet of Christ and it is for
the death of the Son of Man that that gorgeous cavalcade is
passing.</p>
<p>But this restless modern intellectual spirit of ours is not
receptive enough of the sensuous element of art; and so the real
influence of the arts is hidden from many of us: only a few,
escaping from the tyranny of the soul, have learned the secret of
those high hours when thought is not.</p>
<p>And this indeed is the reason of the influence which Eastern
art is having on us in Europe, and of the fascination of all
Japanese work.&nbsp; While the Western world has been laying on
art the intolerable burden of its own intellectual doubts and the
spiritual tragedy of its own sorrows, the East has always kept
true to art&rsquo;s primary and pictorial conditions.</p>
<p>In judging of a beautiful statue the &aelig;sthetic faculty is
absolutely and completely gratified by the splendid curves of
those marble lips that are dumb to our complaint, the noble
modelling of those limbs that are powerless to help us.&nbsp; In
its primary aspect a painting has no more spiritual message or
meaning than an exquisite fragment of Venetian glass or a blue
tile from the wall of Damascus: it is a beautifully coloured
surface, nothing more.&nbsp; The channels by which all noble
imaginative work in painting should touch, and do touch the soul,
are not those of the truths of life, nor metaphysical
truths.&nbsp; But that pictorial charm which does not depend on
any literary reminiscence for its effect on the one hand, nor is
yet a mere result of communicable technical skill on the other,
comes of a certain inventive and creative handling of
colour.&nbsp; Nearly always in Dutch painting and often in the
works of Giorgione or Titian, it is entirely independent of
anything definitely poetical in the subject, a kind of form and
choice in workmanship which is itself entirely satisfying, and is
(as the Greeks would say) an end in itself.</p>
<p>And so in poetry too, the real poetical quality, the joy of
poetry, comes never from the subject but from an inventive
handling of rhythmical language, from what Keats called the
&lsquo;sensuous life of verse.&rsquo;&nbsp; The element of song
in the singing accompanied by the profound joy of motion, is so
sweet that, while the incomplete lives of ordinary men bring no
healing power with them, the thorn-crown of the poet will blossom
into roses for our pleasure; for our delight his despair will
gild its own thorns, and his pain, like Adonis, be beautiful in
its agony; and when the poet&rsquo;s heart breaks it will break
in music.</p>
<p>And health in art&mdash;what is that?&nbsp; It has nothing to
do with a sane criticism of life.&nbsp; There is more health in
Baudelaire than there is in [Kingsley].&nbsp; Health is the
artist&rsquo;s recognition of the limitations of the form in
which he works.&nbsp; It is the honour and the homage which he
gives to the material he uses&mdash;whether it be language with
its glories, or marble or pigment with their
glories&mdash;knowing that the true brotherhood of the arts
consists not in their borrowing one another&rsquo;s method, but
in their producing, each of them by its own individual means,
each of them by keeping its objective limits, the same unique
artistic delight.&nbsp; The delight is like that given to us by
music&mdash;for music is the art in which form and matter are
always one, the art whose subject cannot be separated from the
method of its expression, the art which most completely realises
the artistic ideal, and is the condition to which all the other
arts are constantly aspiring.</p>
<p>And criticism&mdash;what place is that to have in our
culture?&nbsp; Well, I think that the first duty of an art critic
is to hold his tongue at all times, and upon all subjects:
<i>C&rsquo;est un grand avantage de n&rsquo;avoir rien fait</i>,
<i>mais il ne faut pas en abuser</i>.</p>
<p>It is only through the mystery of creation that one can gain
any knowledge of the quality of created things.&nbsp; You have
listened to <i>Patience</i> for a hundred nights and you have
heard me for one only.&nbsp; It will make, no doubt, that satire
more piquant by knowing something about the subject of it, but
you must not judge of &aelig;stheticism by the satire of Mr.
Gilbert.&nbsp; As little should you judge of the strength and
splendour of sun or sea by the dust that dances in the beam, or
the bubble that breaks on the wave, as take your critic for any
sane test of art.&nbsp; For the artists, like the Greek gods, are
revealed only to one another, as Emerson says somewhere; their
real value and place time only can show.&nbsp; In this respect
also omnipotence is with the ages.&nbsp; The true critic
addresses not the artist ever but the public only.&nbsp; His work
lies with them.&nbsp; Art can never have any other claim but her
own perfection: it is for the critic to create for art the social
aim, too, by teaching the people the spirit in which they are to
approach all artistic work, the love they are to give it, the
lesson they are to draw from it.</p>
<p>All these appeals to art to set herself more in harmony with
modern progress and civilisation, and to make herself the
mouthpiece for the voice of humanity, these appeals to art
&lsquo;to have a mission,&rsquo; are appeals which should be made
to the public.&nbsp; The art which has fulfilled the conditions
of beauty has fulfilled all conditions: it is for the critic to
teach the people how to find in the calm of such art the highest
expression of their own most stormy passions.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
no reverence,&rsquo; said Keats, &lsquo;for the public, nor for
anything in existence but the Eternal Being, the memory of great
men and the principle of Beauty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such then is the principle which I believe to be guiding and
underlying our English Renaissance, a Renaissance many-sided and
wonderful, productive of strong ambitions and lofty
personalities, yet for all its splendid achievements in poetry
and in the decorative arts and in painting, for all the increased
comeliness and grace of dress, and the furniture of houses and
the like, not complete.&nbsp; For there can be no great sculpture
without a beautiful national life, and the commercial spirit of
England has killed that; no great drama without a noble national
life, and the commercial spirit of England has killed that
too.</p>
<p>It is not that the flawless serenity of marble cannot bear the
burden of the modern intellectual spirit, or become instinct with
the fire of romantic passion&mdash;the tomb of Duke Lorenzo and
the chapel of the Medici show us that&mdash;but it is that, as
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier used to say, the visible world is dead,
<i>le monde visible a disparu</i>.</p>
<p>Nor is it again that the novel has killed the play, as some
critics would persuade us&mdash;the romantic movement of France
shows us that.&nbsp; The work of Balzac and of Hugo grew up side
by side together; nay, more, were complementary to each other,
though neither of them saw it.&nbsp; While all other forms of
poetry may flourish in an ignoble age, the splendid individualism
of the lyrist, fed by its own passion, and lit by its own power,
may pass as a pillar of fire as well across the desert as across
places that are pleasant.&nbsp; It is none the less glorious
though no man follow it&mdash;nay, by the greater sublimity of
its loneliness it may be quickened into loftier utterance and
intensified into clearer song.&nbsp; From the mean squalor of the
sordid life that limits him, the dreamer or the idyllist may soar
on poesy&rsquo;s viewless wings, may traverse with fawn-skin and
spear the moonlit heights of Cith&aelig;ron though Faun and
Bassarid dance there no more.&nbsp; Like Keats he may wander
through the old-world forests of Latmos, or stand like Morris on
the galley&rsquo;s deck with the Viking when king and galley have
long since passed away.&nbsp; But the drama is the meeting-place
of art and life; it deals, as Mazzini said, not merely with man,
but with social man, with man in his relation to God and to
Humanity.&nbsp; It is the product of a period of great national
united energy; it is impossible without a noble public, and
belongs to such ages as the age of Elizabeth in London and of
Pericles at Athens; it is part of such lofty moral and spiritual
ardour as came to Greek after the defeat of the Persian fleet,
and to Englishman after the wreck of the Armada of Spain.</p>
<p>Shelley felt how incomplete our movement was in this respect,
and has shown in one great tragedy by what terror and pity he
would have purified our age; but in spite of <i>The Cenci</i> the
drama is one of the artistic forms through which the genius of
the England of this century seeks in vain to find outlet and
expression.&nbsp; He has had no worthy imitators.</p>
<p>It is rather, perhaps, to you that we should turn to complete
and perfect this great movement of ours, for there is something
Hellenic in your air and world, something that has a quicker
breath of the joy and power of Elizabeth&rsquo;s England about it
than our ancient civilisation can give us.&nbsp; For you, at
least, are young; &lsquo;no hungry generations tread you
down,&rsquo; and the past does not weary you with the intolerable
burden of its memories nor mock you with the ruins of a beauty,
the secret of whose creation you have lost.&nbsp; That very
absence of tradition, which Mr. Ruskin thought would rob your
rivers of their laughter and your flowers of their light, may be
rather the source of your freedom and your strength.</p>
<p>To speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and
insouciance of the movements of animals, and the
unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and
grass by the roadside, has been defined by one of your poets as a
flawless triumph of art.&nbsp; It is a triumph which you above
all nations may be destined to achieve.&nbsp; For the voices that
have their dwelling in sea and mountain are not the chosen music
of Liberty only; other messages are there in the wonder of
wind-swept height and the majesty of silent deep&mdash;messages
that, if you will but listen to them, may yield you the splendour
of some new imagination, the marvel of some new beauty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I foresee,&rsquo; said Goethe, &lsquo;the dawn of a new
literature which all people may claim as their own, for all have
contributed to its foundation.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, then, this is so,
and if the materials for a civilisation as great as that of
Europe lie all around you, what profit, you will ask me, will all
this study of our poets and painters be to you?&nbsp; I might
answer that the intellect can be engaged without direct didactic
object on an artistic and historical problem; that the demand of
the intellect is merely to feel itself alive; that nothing which
has ever interested men or women can cease to be a fit subject
for culture.</p>
<p>I might remind you of what all Europe owes to the sorrow of a
single Florentine in exile at Verona, or to the love of Petrarch
by that little well in Southern France; nay, more, how even in
this dull, materialistic age the simple expression of an old
man&rsquo;s simple life, passed away from the clamour of great
cities amid the lakes and misty hills of Cumberland, has opened
out for England treasures of new joy compared with which the
treasures of her luxury are as barren as the sea which she has
made her highway, and as bitter as the fire which she would make
her slave.</p>
<p>But I think it will bring you something besides this,
something that is the knowledge of real strength in art: not that
you should imitate the works of these men; but their artistic
spirit, their artistic attitude, I think you should absorb
that.</p>
<p>For in nations, as in individuals, if the passion for creation
be not accompanied by the critical, the &aelig;sthetic faculty
also, it will be sure to waste its strength aimlessly, failing
perhaps in the artistic spirit of choice, or in the mistaking of
feeling for form, or in the following of false ideals.</p>
<p>For the various spiritual forms of the imagination have a
natural affinity with certain sensuous forms of art&mdash;and to
discern the qualities of each art, to intensify as well its
limitations as its powers of expression, is one of the aims that
culture sets before us.&nbsp; It is not an increased moral sense,
an increased moral supervision that your literature needs.&nbsp;
Indeed, one should never talk of a moral or an immoral
poem&mdash;poems are either well written or badly written, that
is all.&nbsp; And, indeed, any element of morals or implied
reference to a standard of good or evil in art is often a sign of
a certain incompleteness of vision, often a note of discord in
the harmony of an imaginative creation; for all good work aims at
a purely artistic effect.&nbsp; &lsquo;We must be careful,&rsquo;
said Goethe, &lsquo;not to be always looking for culture merely
in what is obviously moral.&nbsp; Everything that is great
promotes civilisation as soon as we are aware of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, as in your cities so in your literature, it is a
permanent canon and standard of taste, an increased sensibility
to beauty (if I may say so) that is lacking.&nbsp; All noble work
is not national merely, but universal.&nbsp; The political
independence of a nation must not be confused with any
intellectual isolation.&nbsp; The spiritual freedom, indeed, your
own generous lives and liberal air will give you.&nbsp; From us
you will learn the classical restraint of form.</p>
<p>For all great art is delicate art, roughness having very
little to do with strength, and harshness very little to do with
power.&nbsp; &lsquo;The artist,&rsquo; as Mr. Swinburne says,
&lsquo;must be perfectly articulate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This limitation is for the artist perfect freedom: it is at
once the origin and the sign of his strength.&nbsp; So that all
the supreme masters of style&mdash;Dante, Sophocles,
Shakespeare&mdash;are the supreme masters of spiritual and
intellectual vision also.</p>
<p>Love art for its own sake, and then all things that you need
will be added to you.</p>
<p>This devotion to beauty and to the creation of beautiful
things is the test of all great civilised nations.&nbsp;
Philosophy may teach us to bear with equanimity the misfortunes
of our neighbours, and science resolve the moral sense into a
secretion of sugar, but art is what makes the life of each
citizen a sacrament and not a speculation, art is what makes the
life of the whole race immortal.</p>
<p>For beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm.&nbsp;
Philosophies fall away like sand, and creeds follow one another
like the withered leaves of autumn; but what is beautiful is a
joy for all seasons and a possession for all eternity.</p>
<p>Wars and the clash of armies and the meeting of men in battle
by trampled field or leaguered city, and the rising of nations
there must always be.&nbsp; But I think that art, by creating a
common intellectual atmosphere between all countries,
might&mdash;if it could not overshadow the world with the silver
wings of peace&mdash;at least make men such brothers that they
would not go out to slay one another for the whim or folly of
some king or minister, as they do in Europe.&nbsp; Fraternity
would come no more with the hands of Cain, nor Liberty betray
freedom with the kiss of Anarchy; for national hatreds are always
strongest where culture is lowest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could I?&rsquo; said Goethe, when reproached for
not writing like Korner against the French.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
could I, to whom barbarism and culture alone are of importance,
hate a nation which is among the most cultivated of the earth, a
nation to which I owe a great part of my own
cultivation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mighty empires, too, there must always be as long as personal
ambition and the spirit of the age are one, but art at least is
the only empire which a nation&rsquo;s enemies cannot take from
her by conquest, but which is taken by submission only.&nbsp; The
sovereignty of Greece and Rome is not yet passed away, though the
gods of the one be dead and the eagles of the other tired.</p>
<p>And we in our Renaissance are seeking to create a sovereignty
that will still be England&rsquo;s when her yellow leopards have
grown weary of wars and the rose of her shield is crimsoned no
more with the blood of battle; and you, too, absorbing into the
generous heart of a great people this pervading artistic spirit,
will create for yourselves such riches as you have never yet
created, though your land be a network of railways and your
cities the harbours for the galleys of the world.</p>
<p>I know, indeed, that the divine natural prescience of beauty
which is the inalienable inheritance of Greek and Italian is not
our inheritance.&nbsp; For such an informing and presiding spirit
of art to shield us from all harsh and alien influences, we of
the Northern races must turn rather to that strained
self-consciousness of our age which, as it is the key-note of all
our romantic art, must be the source of all or nearly all our
culture.&nbsp; I mean that intellectual curiosity of the
nineteenth century which is always looking for the secret of the
life that still lingers round old and bygone forms of
culture.&nbsp; It takes from each what is serviceable for the
modern spirit&mdash;from Athens its wonder without its worship,
from Venice its splendour without its sin.&nbsp; The same spirit
is always analysing its own strength and its own weakness,
counting what it owes to East and to West, to the olive-trees of
Colonus and to the palm-trees of Lebanon, to Gethsemane and to
the garden of Proserpine.</p>
<p>And yet the truths of art cannot be taught: they are revealed
only, revealed to natures which have made themselves receptive of
all beautiful impressions by the study and worship of all
beautiful things.&nbsp; And hence the enormous importance given
to the decorative arts in our English Renaissance; hence all that
marvel of design that comes from the hand of Edward Burne-Jones,
all that weaving of tapestry and staining of glass, that
beautiful working in clay and metal and wood which we owe to
William Morris, the greatest handicraftsman we have had in
England since the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>So, in years to come there will be nothing in any man&rsquo;s
house which has not given delight to its maker and does not give
delight to its user.&nbsp; The children, like the children of
Plato&rsquo;s perfect city, will grow up &lsquo;in a simple
atmosphere of all fair things&rsquo;&mdash;I quote from the
passage in the <i>Republic</i>&mdash;&lsquo;a simple atmosphere
of all fair things, where beauty, which is the spirit of art,
will come on eye and ear like a fresh breath of wind that brings
health from a clear upland, and insensibly and gradually draw the
child&rsquo;s soul into harmony with all knowledge and all
wisdom, so that he will love what is beautiful and good, and hate
what is evil and ugly (for they always go together) long before
he knows the reason why; and then when reason comes will kiss her
on the cheek as a friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is what Plato thought decorative art could do for a
nation, feeling that the secret not of philosophy merely but of
all gracious existence might be externally hidden from any one
whose youth had been passed in uncomely and vulgar surroundings,
and that the beauty of form and colour even, as he says, in the
meanest vessels of the house, will find its way into the inmost
places of the soul and lead the boy naturally to look for that
divine harmony of spiritual life of which art was to him the
material symbol and warrant.</p>
<p>Prelude indeed to all knowledge and all wisdom will this love
of beautiful things be for us; yet there are times when wisdom
becomes a burden and knowledge is one with sorrow: for as every
body has its shadow so every soul has its scepticism.&nbsp; In
such dread moments of discord and despair where should we, of
this torn and troubled age, turn our steps if not to that secure
house of beauty where there is always a little forgetfulness,
always a great joy; to that <i>citt&agrave; divina</i>, as the
old Italian heresy called it, the divine city where one can
stand, though only for a brief moment, apart from the division
and terror of the world and the choice of the world too?</p>
<p>This is that <i>consolation des arts</i> which is the key-note
of Gautier&rsquo;s poetry, the secret of modern life
foreshadowed&mdash;as indeed what in our century is not?&mdash;by
Goethe.&nbsp; You remember what he said to the German people:
&lsquo;Only have the courage,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to give
yourselves up to your impressions, allow yourselves to be
delighted, moved, elevated, nay instructed, inspired for
something great.&rsquo;&nbsp; The courage to give yourselves up
to your impressions: yes, that is the secret of the artistic
life&mdash;for while art has been defined as an escape from the
tyranny of the senses, it is an escape rather from the tyranny of
the soul.&nbsp; But only to those who worship her above all
things does she ever reveal her true treasure: else will she be
as powerless to aid you as the mutilated Venus of the Louvre was
before the romantic but sceptical nature of Heine.</p>
<p>And indeed I think it would be impossible to overrate the gain
that might follow if we had about us only what gave pleasure to
the maker of it and gives pleasure to its user, that being the
simplest of all rules about decoration.&nbsp; One thing, at
least, I think it would do for us: there is no surer test of a
great country than how near it stands to its own poets; but
between the singers of our day and the workers to whom they would
sing there seems to be an ever-widening and dividing chasm, a
chasm which slander and mockery cannot traverse, but which is
spanned by the luminous wings of love.</p>
<p>And of such love I think that the abiding presence in our
houses of noble imaginative work would be the surest seed and
preparation.&nbsp; I do not mean merely as regards that direct
literary expression of art by which, from the little
red-and-black cruse of oil or wine, a Greek boy could learn of
the lionlike splendour of Achilles, of the strength of Hector and
the beauty of Paris and the wonder of Helen, long before he stood
and listened in crowded market-place or in theatre of marble; or
by which an Italian child of the fifteenth century could know of
the chastity of Lucrece and the death of Camilla from carven
doorway and from painted chest.&nbsp; For the good we get from
art is not what we learn from it; it is what we become through
it.&nbsp; Its real influence will be in giving the mind that
enthusiasm which is the secret of Hellenism, accustoming it to
demand from art all that art can do in rearranging the facts of
common life for us&mdash;whether it be by giving the most
spiritual interpretation of one&rsquo;s own moments of highest
passion or the most sensuous expression of those thoughts that
are the farthest removed from sense; in accustoming it to love
the things of the imagination for their own sake, and to desire
beauty and grace in all things.&nbsp; For he who does not love
art in all things does not love it at all, and he who does not
need art in all things does not need it at all.</p>
<p>I will not dwell here on what I am sure has delighted you all
in our great Gothic cathedrals.&nbsp; I mean how the artist of
that time, handicraftsman himself in stone or glass, found the
best motives for his art, always ready for his hand and always
beautiful, in the daily work of the artificers he saw around
him&mdash;as in those lovely windows of Chartres&mdash;where the
dyer dips in the vat and the potter sits at the wheel, and the
weaver stands at the loom: real manufacturers these, workers with
the hand, and entirely delightful to look at, not like the smug
and vapid shopman of our time, who knows nothing of the web or
vase he sells, except that he is charging you double its value
and thinking you a fool for buying it.&nbsp; Nor can I but just
note, in passing, the immense influence the decorative work of
Greece and Italy had on its artists, the one teaching the
sculptor that restraining influence of design which is the glory
of the Parthenon, the other keeping painting always true to its
primary, pictorial condition of noble colour which is the secret
of the school of Venice; for I wish rather, in this lecture at
least, to dwell on the effect that decorative art has on human
life&mdash;on its social not its purely artistic effect.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of men in the world, two great creeds, two
different forms of natures: men to whom the end of life is
action, and men to whom the end of life is thought.&nbsp; As
regards the latter, who seek for experience itself and not for
the fruits of experience, who must burn always with one of the
passions of this fiery-coloured world, who find life interesting
not for its secret but for its situations, for its pulsations and
not for its purpose; the passion for beauty engendered by the
decorative arts will be to them more satisfying than any
political or religious enthusiasm, any enthusiasm for humanity,
any ecstasy or sorrow for love.&nbsp; For art comes to one
professing primarily to give nothing but the highest quality to
one&rsquo;s moments, and for those moments&rsquo; sake.&nbsp; So
far for those to whom the end of life is thought.&nbsp; As
regards the others, who hold that life is inseparable from
labour, to them should this movement be specially dear: for, if
our days are barren without industry, industry without art is
barbarism.</p>
<p>Hewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always
indeed among us.&nbsp; Our modern machinery has not much
lightened the labour of man after all: but at least let the
pitcher that stands by the well be beautiful and surely the
labour of the day will be lightened: let the wood be made
receptive of some lovely form, some gracious design, and there
will come no longer discontent but joy to the toiler.&nbsp; For
what is decoration but the worker&rsquo;s expression of joy in
his work?&nbsp; And not joy merely&mdash;that is a great thing
yet not enough&mdash;but that opportunity of expressing his own
individuality which, as it is the essence of all life, is the
source of all art.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have tried,&rsquo; I remember
William Morris saying to me once, &lsquo;I have tried to make
each of my workers an artist, and when I say an artist I mean a
man.&rsquo;&nbsp; For the worker then, handicraftsman of whatever
kind he is, art is no longer to be a purple robe woven by a slave
and thrown over the whitened body of a leprous king to hide and
to adorn the sin of his luxury, but rather the beautiful and
noble expression of a life that has in it something beautiful and
noble.</p>
<p>And so you must seek out your workman and give him, as far as
possible, the right surroundings, for remember that the real test
and virtue of a workman is not his earnestness nor his industry
even, but his power of design merely; and that &lsquo;design is
not the offspring of idle fancy: it is the studied result of
accumulative observation and delightful habit.&rsquo;&nbsp; All
the teaching in the world is of no avail if you do not surround
your workman with happy influences and with beautiful
things.&nbsp; It is impossible for him to have right ideas about
colour unless he sees the lovely colours of Nature unspoiled;
impossible for him to supply beautiful incident and action unless
he sees beautiful incident and action in the world about him.</p>
<p>For to cultivate sympathy you must be among living things and
thinking about them, and to cultivate admiration you must be
among beautiful things and looking at them.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
steel of Toledo and the silk of Genoa did but give strength to
oppression and lustre to pride,&rsquo; as Mr. Ruskin says; let it
be for you to create an art that is made by the hands of the
people for the joy of the people, to please the hearts of the
people, too; an art that will be your expression of your delight
in life.&nbsp; There is nothing &lsquo;in common life too mean,
in common things too trivial to be ennobled by your touch&rsquo;;
nothing in life that art cannot sanctify.</p>
<p>You have heard, I think, a few of you, of two flowers
connected with the &aelig;sthetic movement in England, and said
(I assure you, erroneously) to be the food of some &aelig;sthetic
young men.&nbsp; Well, let me tell you that the reason we love
the lily and the sunflower, in spite of what Mr. Gilbert may tell
you, is not for any vegetable fashion at all.&nbsp; It is because
these two lovely flowers are in England the two most perfect
models of design, the most naturally adapted for decorative
art&mdash;the gaudy leonine beauty of the one and the precious
loveliness of the other giving to the artist the most entire and
perfect joy.&nbsp; And so with you: let there be no flower in
your meadows that does not wreathe its tendrils around your
pillows, no little leaf in your Titan forests that does not lend
its form to design, no curving spray of wild rose or brier that
does not live for ever in carven arch or window or marble, no
bird in your air that is not giving the iridescent wonder of its
colour, the exquisite curves of its wings in flight, to make more
precious the preciousness of simple adornment.</p>
<p>We spend our days, each one of us, in looking for the secret
of life.&nbsp; Well, the secret of life is in art.</p>

157</span>HOUSE DECORATION</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A lecture delivered in America during
Wilde&rsquo;s tour in 1882.&nbsp; It was announced as a lecture
on &lsquo;The Practical Application of the Principles of
&AElig;sthetic Theory to Exterior and Interior House Decoration,
With Observations upon Dress and Personal Ornaments.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The earliest date on which it is known to have been given is May
11, 1882.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my last lecture I gave you
something of the history of Art in England.&nbsp; I sought to
trace the influence of the French Revolution upon its
development.&nbsp; I said something of the song of Keats and the
school of the pre-Raphaelites.&nbsp; But I do not want to shelter
the movement, which I have called the English Renaissance, under
any palladium however noble, or any name however revered.&nbsp;
The roots of it have, indeed, to be sought for in things that
have long passed away, and not, as some suppose, in the fancy of
a few young men&mdash;although I am not altogether sure that
there is anything much better than the fancy of a few young
men.</p>
<p>When I appeared before you on a previous occasion, I had seen
nothing of American art save the Doric columns and Corinthian
chimney-pots visible on your Broadway and Fifth Avenue.&nbsp;
Since then, I have been through your country to some fifty or
sixty different cities, I think.&nbsp; I find that what your
people need is not so much high imaginative art but that which
hallows the vessels of everyday use.&nbsp; I suppose that the
poet will sing and the artist will paint regardless whether the
world praises or blames.&nbsp; He has his own world and is
independent of his fellow-men.&nbsp; But the handicraftsman is
dependent on your pleasure and opinion.&nbsp; He needs your
encouragement and he must have beautiful surroundings.&nbsp; Your
people love art but do not sufficiently honour the
handicraftsman.&nbsp; Of course, those millionaires who can
pillage Europe for their pleasure need have no care to encourage
such; but I speak for those whose desire for beautiful things is
larger than their means.&nbsp; I find that one great trouble all
over is that your workmen are not given to noble designs.&nbsp;
You cannot be indifferent to this, because Art is not something
which you can take or leave.&nbsp; It is a necessity of human
life.</p>
<p>And what is the meaning of this beautiful decoration which we
call art?&nbsp; In the first place, it means value to the workman
and it means the pleasure which he must necessarily take in
making a beautiful thing.&nbsp; The mark of all good art is not
that the thing done is done exactly or finely, for machinery may
do as much, but that it is worked out with the head and the
workman&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; I cannot impress the point too
frequently that beautiful and rational designs are necessary in
all work.&nbsp; I did not imagine, until I went into some of your
simpler cities, that there was so much bad work done.&nbsp; I
found, where I went, bad wall-papers horribly designed, and
coloured carpets, and that old offender the horse-hair sofa,
whose stolid look of indifference is always so depressing.&nbsp;
I found meaningless chandeliers and machine-made furniture,
generally of rosewood, which creaked dismally under the weight of
the ubiquitous interviewer.&nbsp; I came across the small iron
stove which they always persist in decorating with machine-made
ornaments, and which is as great a bore as a wet day or any other
particularly dreadful institution.&nbsp; When unusual
extravagance was indulged in, it was garnished with two funeral
urns.</p>
<p>It must always be remembered that what is well and carefully
made by an honest workman, after a rational design, increases in
beauty and value as the years go on.&nbsp; The old furniture
brought over by the Pilgrims, two hundred years ago, which I saw
in New England, is just as good and as beautiful to-day as it was
when it first came here.&nbsp; Now, what you must do is to bring
artists and handicraftsmen together.&nbsp; Handicraftsmen cannot
live, certainly cannot thrive, without such companionship.&nbsp;
Separate these two and you rob art of all spiritual motive.</p>
<p>Having done this, you must place your workman in the midst of
beautiful surroundings.&nbsp; The artist is not dependent on the
visible and the tangible.&nbsp; He has his visions and his dreams
to feed on.&nbsp; But the workman must see lovely forms as he
goes to his work in the morning and returns at eventide.&nbsp;
And, in connection with this, I want to assure you that noble and
beautiful designs are never the result of idle fancy or
purposeless day-dreaming.&nbsp; They come only as the
accumulation of habits of long and delightful observation.&nbsp;
And yet such things may not be taught.&nbsp; Right ideas
concerning them can certainly be obtained only by those who have
been accustomed to rooms that are beautiful and colours that are
satisfying.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most difficult things for us to do is to
choose a notable and joyous dress for men.&nbsp; There would be
more joy in life if we were to accustom ourselves to use all the
beautiful colours we can in fashioning our own clothes.&nbsp; The
dress of the future, I think, will use drapery to a great extent
and will abound with joyous colour.&nbsp; At present we have lost
all nobility of dress and, in doing so, have almost annihilated
the modern sculptor.&nbsp; And, in looking around at the figures
which adorn our parks, one could almost wish that we had
completely killed the noble art.&nbsp; To see the frock-coat of
the drawing-room done in bronze, or the double waistcoat
perpetuated in marble, adds a new horror to death.&nbsp; But
indeed, in looking through the history of costume, seeking an
answer to the questions we have propounded, there is little that
is either beautiful or appropriate.&nbsp; One of the earliest
forms is the Greek drapery which is exquisite for young
girls.&nbsp; And then, I think we may be pardoned a little
enthusiasm over the dress of the time of Charles I., so beautiful
indeed, that in spite of its invention being with the Cavaliers
it was copied by the Puritans.&nbsp; And the dress for the
children of that time must not be passed over.&nbsp; It was a
very golden age of the little ones.&nbsp; I do not think that
they have ever looked so lovely as they do in the pictures of
that time.&nbsp; The dress of the last century in England is also
peculiarly gracious and graceful.&nbsp; There is nothing bizarre
or strange about it, but it is full of harmony and beauty.&nbsp;
In these days, when we have suffered dreadfully from the
incursions of the modern milliner, we hear ladies boast that they
do not wear a dress more than once.&nbsp; In the old days, when
the dresses were decorated with beautiful designs and worked with
exquisite embroidery, ladies rather took a pride in bringing out
the garment and wearing it many times and handing it down to
their daughters&mdash;a process that would, I think, be quite
appreciated by a modern husband when called upon to settle his
wife&rsquo;s bills.</p>
<p>And how shall men dress?&nbsp; Men say that they do not
particularly care how they dress, and that it is little
matter.&nbsp; I am bound to reply that I do not think that you
do.&nbsp; In all my journeys through the country, the only
well-dressed men that I saw&mdash;and in saying this I earnestly
deprecate the polished indignation of your Fifth Avenue
dandies&mdash;were the Western miners.&nbsp; Their wide-brimmed
hats, which shaded their faces from the sun and protected them
from the rain, and the cloak, which is by far the most beautiful
piece of drapery ever invented, may well be dwelt on with
admiration.&nbsp; Their high boots, too, were sensible and
practical.&nbsp; They wore only what was comfortable, and
therefore beautiful.&nbsp; As I looked at them I could not help
thinking with regret of the time when these picturesque miners
would have made their fortunes and would go East to assume again
all the abominations of modern fashionable attire.&nbsp; Indeed,
so concerned was I that I made some of them promise that when
they again appeared in the more crowded scenes of Eastern
civilisation they would still continue to wear their lovely
costume.&nbsp; But I do not believe they will.</p>
<p>Now, what America wants to-day is a school of rational
art.&nbsp; Bad art is a great deal worse than no art at
all.&nbsp; You must show your workmen specimens of good work so
that they come to know what is simple and true and
beautiful.&nbsp; To that end I would have you have a museum
attached to these schools&mdash;not one of those dreadful modern
institutions where there is a stuffed and very dusty giraffe, and
a case or two of fossils, but a place where there are gathered
examples of art decoration from various periods and
countries.&nbsp; Such a place is the South Kensington Museum in
London, whereon we build greater hopes for the future than on any
other one thing.&nbsp; There I go every Saturday night, when the
museum is open later than usual, to see the handicraftsman, the
wood-worker, the glass-blower and the worker in metals.&nbsp; And
it is here that the man of refinement and culture comes face to
face with the workman who ministers to his joy.&nbsp; He comes to
know more of the nobility of the workman, and the workman,
feeling the appreciation, comes to know more of the nobility of
his work.</p>
<p>You have too many white walls.&nbsp; More colour is
wanted.&nbsp; You should have such men as Whistler among you to
teach you the beauty and joy of colour.&nbsp; Take Mr.
Whistler&rsquo;s &lsquo;Symphony in White,&rsquo; which you no
doubt have imagined to be something quite bizarre.&nbsp; It is
nothing of the sort.&nbsp; Think of a cool grey sky flecked here
and there with white clouds, a grey ocean and three wonderfully
beautiful figures robed in white, leaning over the water and
dropping white flowers from their fingers.&nbsp; Here is no
extensive intellectual scheme to trouble you, and no metaphysics
of which we have had quite enough in art.&nbsp; But if the simple
and unaided colour strike the right key-note, the whole
conception is made clear.&nbsp; I regard Mr. Whistler&rsquo;s
famous Peacock Room as the finest thing in colour and art
decoration which the world has known since Correggio painted that
wonderful room in Italy where the little children are dancing on
the walls.&nbsp; Mr. Whistler finished another room just before I
came away&mdash;a breakfast room in blue and yellow.&nbsp; The
ceiling was a light blue, the cabinet-work and the furniture were
of a yellow wood, the curtains at the windows were white and
worked in yellow, and when the table was set for breakfast with
dainty blue china nothing can be conceived at once so simple and
so joyous.</p>
<p>The fault which I have observed in most of your rooms is that
there is apparent no definite scheme of colour.&nbsp; Everything
is not attuned to a key-note as it should be.&nbsp; The
apartments are crowded with pretty things which have no relation
to one another.&nbsp; Again, your artists must decorate what is
more simply useful.&nbsp; In your art schools I found no attempt
to decorate such things as the vessels for water.&nbsp; I know of
nothing uglier than the ordinary jug or pitcher.&nbsp; A museum
could be filled with the different kinds of water vessels which
are used in hot countries.&nbsp; Yet we continue to submit to the
depressing jug with the handle all on one side.&nbsp; I do not
see the wisdom of decorating dinner-plates with sunsets and
soup-plates with moonlight scenes.&nbsp; I do not think it adds
anything to the pleasure of the canvas-back duck to take it out
of such glories.&nbsp; Besides, we do not want a soup-plate whose
bottom seems to vanish in the distance.&nbsp; One feels neither
safe nor comfortable under such conditions.&nbsp; In fact, I did
not find in the art schools of the country that the difference
was explained between decorative and imaginative art.</p>
<p>The conditions of art should be simple.&nbsp; A great deal
more depends upon the heart than upon the head.&nbsp;
Appreciation of art is not secured by any elaborate scheme of
learning.&nbsp; Art requires a good healthy atmosphere.&nbsp; The
motives for art are still around about us as they were round
about the ancients.&nbsp; And the subjects are also easily found
by the earnest sculptor and the painter.&nbsp; Nothing is more
picturesque and graceful than a man at work.&nbsp; The artist who
goes to the children&rsquo;s playground, watches them at their
sport and sees the boy stoop to tie his shoe, will find the same
themes that engaged the attention of the ancient Greeks, and such
observation and the illustrations which follow will do much to
correct that foolish impression that mental and physical beauty
are always divorced.</p>
<p>To you, more than perhaps to any other country, has Nature
been generous in furnishing material for art workers to work
in.&nbsp; You have marble quarries where the stone is more
beautiful in colour than any the Greeks ever had for their
beautiful work, and yet day after day I am confronted with the
great building of some stupid man who has used the beautiful
material as if it were not precious almost beyond speech.&nbsp;
Marble should not be used save by noble workmen.&nbsp; There is
nothing which gave me a greater sense of barrenness in travelling
through the country than the entire absence of wood carving on
your houses.&nbsp; Wood carving is the simplest of the decorative
arts.&nbsp; In Switzerland the little barefooted boy beautifies
the porch of his father&rsquo;s house with examples of skill in
this direction.&nbsp; Why should not American boys do a great
deal more and better than Swiss boys?</p>
<p>There is nothing to my mind more coarse in conception and more
vulgar in execution than modern jewellery.&nbsp; This is
something that can easily be corrected.&nbsp; Something better
should be made out of the beautiful gold which is stored up in
your mountain hollows and strewn along your river beds.&nbsp;
When I was at Leadville and reflected that all the shining silver
that I saw coming from the mines would be made into ugly dollars,
it made me sad.&nbsp; It should be made into something more
permanent.&nbsp; The golden gates at Florence are as beautiful
to-day as when Michael Angelo saw them.</p>
<p>We should see more of the workman than we do.&nbsp; We should
not be content to have the salesman stand between us&mdash;the
salesman who knows nothing of what he is selling save that he is
charging a great deal too much for it.&nbsp; And watching the
workman will teach that most important lesson&mdash;the nobility
of all rational workmanship.</p>
<p>I said in my last lecture that art would create a new
brotherhood among men by furnishing a universal language.&nbsp; I
said that under its beneficent influences war might pass
away.&nbsp; Thinking this, what place can I ascribe to art in our
education?&nbsp; If children grow up among all fair and lovely
things, they will grow to love beauty and detest ugliness before
they know the reason why.&nbsp; If you go into a house where
everything is coarse, you find things chipped and broken and
unsightly.&nbsp; Nobody exercises any care.&nbsp; If everything
is dainty and delicate, gentleness and refinement of manner are
unconsciously acquired.&nbsp; When I was in San Francisco I used
to visit the Chinese Quarter frequently.&nbsp; There I used to
watch a great hulking Chinese workman at his task of digging, and
used to see him every day drink his tea from a little cup as
delicate in texture as the petal of a flower, whereas in all the
grand hotels of the land, where thousands of dollars have been
lavished on great gilt mirrors and gaudy columns, I have been
given my coffee or my chocolate in cups an inch and a quarter
thick.&nbsp; I think I have deserved something nicer.</p>
<p>The art systems of the past have been devised by philosophers
who looked upon human beings as obstructions.&nbsp; They have
tried to educate boys&rsquo; minds before they had any.&nbsp; How
much better it would be in these early years to teach children to
use their hands in the rational service of mankind.&nbsp; I would
have a workshop attached to every school, and one hour a day
given up to the teaching of simple decorative arts.&nbsp; It
would be a golden hour to the children.&nbsp; And you would soon
raise up a race of handicraftsmen who would transform the face of
your country.&nbsp; I have seen only one such school in the
United States, and this was in Philadelphia and was founded by my
friend Mr. Leyland.&nbsp; I stopped there yesterday and have
brought some of the work here this afternoon to show you.&nbsp;
Here are two disks of beaten brass: the designs on them are
beautiful, the workmanship is simple, and the entire result is
satisfactory.&nbsp; The work was done by a little boy twelve
years old.&nbsp; This is a wooden bowl decorated by a little girl
of thirteen.&nbsp; The design is lovely and the colouring
delicate and pretty.&nbsp; Here you see a piece of beautiful wood
carving accomplished by a little boy of nine.&nbsp; In such work
as this, children learn sincerity in art.&nbsp; They learn to
abhor the liar in art&mdash;the man who paints wood to look like
iron, or iron to look like stone.&nbsp; It is a practical school
of morals.&nbsp; No better way is there to learn to love Nature
than to understand Art.&nbsp; It dignifies every flower of the
field.&nbsp; And, the boy who sees the thing of beauty which a
bird on the wing becomes when transferred to wood or canvas will
probably not throw the customary stone.&nbsp; What we want is
something spiritual added to life.&nbsp; Nothing is so ignoble
that Art cannot sanctify it.</p>
<h2><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>ART
AND THE HANDICRAFTSMAN</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The fragments of which this lecture is
composed are taken entirely from the original manuscripts which
have but recently been discovered.&nbsp; It is not certain that
they all belong to the same lecture, nor that all were written at
the same period.&nbsp; Some portions were written in Philadelphia
in 1882.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">People</span> often talk as if there was
an opposition between what is beautiful and what is useful.&nbsp;
There is no opposition to beauty except ugliness: all things are
either beautiful or ugly, and utility will be always on the side
of the beautiful thing, because beautiful decoration is always on
the side of the beautiful thing, because beautiful decoration is
always an expression of the use you put a thing to and the value
placed on it.&nbsp; No workman will beautifully decorate bad
work, nor can you possibly get good handicraftsmen or workmen
without having beautiful designs.&nbsp; You should be quite sure
of that.&nbsp; If you have poor and worthless designs in any
craft or trade you will get poor and worthless workmen only, but
the minute you have noble and beautiful designs, then you get men
of power and intellect and feeling to work for you.&nbsp; By
having good designs you have workmen who work not merely with
their hands but with their hearts and heads too; otherwise you
will get merely the fool or the loafer to work for you.</p>
<p>That the beauty of life is a thing of no moment, I suppose few
people would venture to assert.&nbsp; And yet most civilised
people act as if it were of none, and in so doing are wronging
both themselves and those that are to come after them.&nbsp; For
that beauty which is meant by art is no mere accident of human
life which people can take or leave, but a positive necessity of
life if we are to live as nature meant us to, that is to say
unless we are content to be less than men.</p>
<p>Do not think that the commercial spirit which is the basis of
your life and cities here is opposed to art.&nbsp; Who built the
beautiful cities of the world but commercial men and commercial
men only?&nbsp; Genoa built by its traders, Florence by its
bankers, and Venice, most lovely of all, by its noble and honest
merchants.</p>
<p>I do not wish you, remember, &lsquo;to build a new
Pisa,&rsquo; nor to bring &lsquo;the life or the decorations of
the thirteenth century back again.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The
circumstances with which you must surround your workmen are
those&rsquo; of modern American life, &lsquo;because the designs
you have now to ask for from your workmen are such as will make
modern&rsquo; American &lsquo;life beautiful.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
art we want is the art based on all the inventions of modern
civilisation, and to suit all the needs of nineteenth-century
life.</p>
<p>Do you think, for instance, that we object to machinery?&nbsp;
I tell you we reverence it; we reverence it when it does its
proper work, when it relieves man from ignoble and soulless
labour, not when it seeks to do that which is valuable only when
wrought by the hands and hearts of men.&nbsp; Let us have no
machine-made ornament at all; it is all bad and worthless and
ugly.&nbsp; And let us not mistake the means of civilisation for
the end of civilisation; steam-engine, telephone and the like,
are all wonderful, but remember that their value depends entirely
on the noble uses we make of them, on the noble spirit in which
we employ them, not on the things themselves.</p>
<p>It is, no doubt, a great advantage to talk to a man at the
Antipodes through a telephone; its advantage depends entirely on
the value of what the two men have to say to one another.&nbsp;
If one merely shrieks slander through a tube and the other
whispers folly into a wire, do not think that anybody is very
much benefited by the invention.</p>
<p>The train that whirls an ordinary Englishman through Italy at
the rate of forty miles an hour and finally sends him home
without any memory of that lovely country but that he was cheated
by a courier at Rome, or that he got a bad dinner at Verona, does
not do him or civilisation much good.&nbsp; But that swift legion
of fiery-footed engines that bore to the burning ruins of Chicago
the loving help and generous treasure of the world was as noble
and as beautiful as any golden troop of angels that ever fed the
hungry and clothed the naked in the antique times.&nbsp; As
beautiful, yes; all machinery may be beautiful when it is
undecorated even.&nbsp; Do not seek to decorate it.&nbsp; We
cannot but think all good machinery is graceful, also, the line
of strength and the line of beauty being one.</p>
<p>Give then, as I said, to your workmen of to-day the bright and
noble surroundings that you can yourself create.&nbsp; Stately
and simple architecture for your cities, bright and simple dress
for your men and women; those are the conditions of a real
artistic movement.&nbsp; For the artist is not concerned
primarily with any theory of life but with life itself, with the
joy and loveliness that should come daily on eye and ear for a
beautiful external world.</p>
<p>But the simplicity must not be barrenness nor the bright
colour gaudy.&nbsp; For all beautiful colours are graduated
colours, the colours that seem about to pass into one
another&rsquo;s realm&mdash;colour without tone being like music
without harmony, mere discord.&nbsp; Barren architecture, the
vulgar and glaring advertisements that desecrate not merely your
cities but every rock and river that I have seen yet in
America&mdash;all this is not enough.&nbsp; A school of design we
must have too in each city.&nbsp; It should be a stately and
noble building, full of the best examples of the best art of the
world.&nbsp; Furthermore, do not put your designers in a barren
whitewashed room and bid them work in that depressing and
colourless atmosphere as I have seen many of the American schools
of design, but give them beautiful surroundings.&nbsp; Because
you want to produce a permanent canon and standard of taste in
your workman, he must have always by him and before him specimens
of the best decorative art of the world, so that you can say to
him: &lsquo;This is good work.&nbsp; Greek or Italian or Japanese
wrought it so many years ago, but it is eternally young because
eternally beautiful.&rsquo;&nbsp; Work in this spirit and you
will be sure to be right.&nbsp; Do not copy it, but work with the
same love, the same reverence, the same freedom of
imagination.&nbsp; You must teach him colour and design, how all
beautiful colours are graduated colours and glaring colours the
essence of vulgarity.&nbsp; Show him the quality of any beautiful
work of nature like the rose, or any beautiful work of art like
an Eastern carpet&mdash;being merely the exquisite gradation of
colour, one tone answering another like the answering chords of a
symphony.&nbsp; Teach him how the true designer is not he who
makes the design and then colours it, but he who designs in
colour, creates in colour, thinks in colour too.&nbsp; Show him
how the most gorgeous stained-glass windows of Europe are filled
with white glass, and the most gorgeous Eastern tapestry with
toned colours&mdash;the primary colours in both places being set
in the white glass, and the tone colours like brilliant jewels
set in dusky gold.&nbsp; And then as regards design, show him how
the real designer will take first any given limited space, little
disk of silver, it may be, like a Greek coin, or wide expanse of
fretted ceiling or lordly wall as Tintoret chose at Venice (it
does not matter which), and to this limited space&mdash;the first
condition of decoration being the limitation of the size of the
material used&mdash;he will give the effect of its being filled
with beautiful decoration, filled with it as a golden cup will be
filled with wine, so complete that you should not be able to take
away anything from it or add anything to it.&nbsp; For from a
good piece of design you can take away nothing, nor can you add
anything to it, each little bit of design being as absolutely
necessary and as vitally important to the whole effect as a note
or chord of music is for a sonata of Beethoven.</p>
<p>But I said the effect of its being so filled, because this,
again, is of the essence of good design.&nbsp; With a simple
spray of leaves and a bird in flight a Japanese artist will give
you the impression that he has completely covered with lovely
design the reed fan or lacquer cabinet at which he is working,
merely because he knows the exact spot in which to place
them.&nbsp; All good design depends on the texture of the utensil
used and the use you wish to put it to.&nbsp; One of the first
things I saw in an American school of design was a young lady
painting a romantic moonlight landscape on a large round dish,
and another young lady covering a set of dinner plates with a
series of sunsets of the most remarkable colours.&nbsp; Let your
ladies paint moonlight landscapes and sunsets, but do not let
them paint them on dinner plates or dishes.&nbsp; Let them take
canvas or paper for such work, but not clay or china.&nbsp; They
are merely painting the wrong subjects on the wrong material,
that is all.&nbsp; They have not been taught that every material
and texture has certain qualities of its own.&nbsp; The design
suitable for one is quite wrong for the other, just as the design
which you should work on a flat table-cover ought to be quite
different from the design you would work on a curtain, for the
one will always be straight, the other broken into folds; and the
use too one puts the object to should guide one in the choice of
design.&nbsp; One does not want to eat one&rsquo;s terrapins off
a romantic moonlight nor one&rsquo;s clams off a harrowing
sunset.&nbsp; Glory of sun and moon, let them be wrought for us
by our landscape artist and be on the walls of the rooms we sit
in to remind us of the undying beauty of the sunsets that fade
and die, but do not let us eat our soup off them and send them
down to the kitchen twice a day to be washed and scrubbed by the
handmaid.</p>
<p>All these things are simple enough, yet nearly always
forgotten.&nbsp; Your school of design here will teach your girls
and your boys, your handicraftsmen of the future (for all your
schools of art should be local schools, the schools of particular
cities).&nbsp; We talk of the Italian school of painting, but
there is no Italian school; there were the schools of each
city.&nbsp; Every town in Italy, from Venice itself, queen of the
sea, to the little hill fortress of Perugia, each had its own
school of art, each different and all beautiful.</p>
<p>So do not mind what art Philadelphia or New York is having,
but make by the hands of your own citizens beautiful art for the
joy of your own citizens, for you have here the primary elements
of a great artistic movement.</p>
<p>For, believe me, the conditions of art are much simpler than
people imagine.&nbsp; For the noblest art one requires a clear
healthy atmosphere, not polluted as the air of our English cities
is by the smoke and grime and horridness which comes from open
furnace and from factory chimney.&nbsp; You must have strong,
sane, healthy physique among your men and women.&nbsp; Sickly or
idle or melancholy people do not do much in art.&nbsp; And
lastly, you require a sense of individualism about each man and
woman, for this is the essence of art&mdash;a desire on the part
of man to express himself in the noblest way possible.&nbsp; And
this is the reason that the grandest art of the world always came
from a republic: Athens, Venice, and Florence&mdash;there were no
kings there and so their art was as noble and simple as
sincere.&nbsp; But if you want to know what kind of art the folly
of kings will impose on a country look at the decorative art of
France under the <i>grand monarque</i>, under Louis the
Fourteenth; the gaudy gilt furniture writhing under a sense of
its own horror and ugliness, with a nymph smirking at every angle
and a dragon mouthing on every claw.&nbsp; Unreal and monstrous
art this, and fit only for such periwigged pomposities as the
nobility of France at that time, but not at all fit for you or
me.&nbsp; We do not want the rich to possess more beautiful
things but the poor to create more beautiful things; for ever man
is poor who cannot create.&nbsp; Nor shall the art which you and
I need be merely a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over
the whitened body of some leprous king to adorn or to conceal the
sin of his luxury, but rather shall it be the noble and beautiful
expression of a people&rsquo;s noble and beautiful life.&nbsp;
Art shall be again the most glorious of all the chords through
which the spirit of a great nation finds its noblest
utterance.</p>
<p>All around you, I said, lie the conditions for a great
artistic movement for every great art.&nbsp; Let us think of one
of them; a sculptor, for instance.</p>
<p>If a modern sculptor were to come and say, &lsquo;Very well,
but where can one find subjects for sculpture out of men who wear
frock-coats and chimney-pot hats?&rsquo; I would tell him to go
to the docks of a great city and watch the men loading or
unloading the stately ships, working at wheel or windlass,
hauling at rope or gangway.&nbsp; I have never watched a man do
anything useful who has not been graceful at some moment of his
labour: it is only the loafer and the idle saunterer who is as
useless and uninteresting to the artist as he is to
himself.&nbsp; I would ask the sculptor to go with me to any of
your schools or universities, to the running ground and
gymnasium, to watch the young men start for a race, hurling quoit
or club, kneeling to tie their shoes before leaping, stepping
from the boat or bending to the oar, and to carve them; and when
he was weary of cities I would ask him to come to your fields and
meadows to watch the reaper with his sickle and the cattle-driver
with lifted lasso.&nbsp; For if a man cannot find the noblest
motives for his art in such simple daily things as a woman
drawing water from the well or a man leaning with his scythe, he
will not find them anywhere at all.&nbsp; Gods and goddesses the
Greek carved because he loved them; saint and king the Goth
because he believed in them.&nbsp; But you, you do not care much
for Greek gods and goddesses, and you are perfectly and entirely
right; and you do not think much of kings either, and you are
quite right.&nbsp; But what you do love are your own men and
women, your own flowers and fields, your own hills and mountains,
and these are what your art should represent to you.</p>
<p>Ours has been the first movement which has brought the
handicraftsman and the artist together, for remember that by
separating the one from the other you do ruin to both; you rob
the one of all spiritual motive and all imaginative joy, you
isolate the other from all real technical perfection.&nbsp; The
two greatest schools of art in the world, the sculptor at Athens
and the school of painting at Venice, had their origin entirely
in a long succession of simple and earnest handicraftsmen.&nbsp;
It was the Greek potter who taught the sculptor that restraining
influence of design which was the glory of the Parthenon; it was
the Italian decorator of chests and household goods who kept
Venetian painting always true to its primary pictorial condition
of noble colour.&nbsp; For we should remember that all the arts
are fine arts and all the arts decorative arts.&nbsp; The
greatest triumph of Italian painting was the decoration of a
pope&rsquo;s chapel in Rome and the wall of a room in
Venice.&nbsp; Michael Angelo wrought the one, and Tintoret, the
dyer&rsquo;s son, the other.&nbsp; And the little &lsquo;Dutch
landscape, which you put over your sideboard to-day, and between
the windows to-morrow, is&rsquo; no less a glorious &lsquo;piece
of work than the extents of field and forest with which Benozzo
has made green and beautiful the once melancholy arcade of the
Campo Santo at Pisa,&rsquo; as Ruskin says.</p>
<p>Do not imitate the works of a nation, Greek or Japanese,
Italian or English; but their artistic spirit of design and their
artistic attitude to-day, their own world, you should absorb but
imitate never, copy never.&nbsp; Unless you can make as beautiful
a design in painted china or embroidered screen or beaten brass
out of your American turkey as the Japanese does out of his grey
silver-winged stork, you will never do anything.&nbsp; Let the
Greek carve his lions and the Goth his dragons: buffalo and wild
deer are the animals for you.</p>
<p>Golden rod and aster and rose and all the flowers that cover
your valleys in the spring and your hills in the autumn: let them
be the flowers for your art.&nbsp; Not merely has Nature given
you the noblest motives for a new school of decoration, but to
you above all other countries has she given the utensils to work
in.</p>
<p>You have quarries of marble richer than Pentelicus, more
varied than Paros, but do not build a great white square house of
marble and think that it is beautiful, or that you are using
marble nobly.&nbsp; If you build in marble you must either carve
it into joyous decoration, like the lives of dancing children
that adorn the marble castles of the Loire, or fill it with
beautiful sculpture, frieze and pediment, as the Greeks did, or
inlay it with other coloured marbles as they did in Venice.&nbsp;
Otherwise you had better build in simple red brick as your
Puritan fathers, with no pretence and with some beauty.&nbsp; Do
not treat your marble as if it was ordinary stone and build a
house of mere blocks of it.&nbsp; For it is indeed a precious
stone, this marble of yours, and only workmen of nobility of
invention and delicacy of hand should be allowed to touch it at
all, carving it into noble statues or into beautiful decoration,
or inlaying it with other coloured marbles: for &lsquo;the true
colours of architecture are those of natural stone, and I would
fain see them taken advantage of to the full.&nbsp; Every variety
is here, from pale yellow to purple passing through orange, red,
and brown, entirely at your command; nearly every kind of green
and grey also is attainable, and with these and with pure white
what harmony might you not achieve.&nbsp; Of stained and
variegated stone the quantity is unlimited, the kinds
innumerable.&nbsp; Were brighter colours required, let glass, and
gold protected by glass, be used in mosaic, a kind of work as
durable as the solid stone and incapable of losing its lustre by
time.&nbsp; And let the painter&rsquo;s work be reserved for the
shadowed loggia and inner chamber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the true and faithful way of building.&nbsp;
Where this cannot be, the device of external colouring may indeed
be employed without dishonour&mdash;but it must be with the
warning reflection that a time will come when such aids will pass
away and when the building will be judged in its lifelessness,
dying the death of the dolphin.&nbsp; Better the less bright,
more enduring fabric.&nbsp; The transparent alabasters of San
Miniato and the mosaics of Saint Mark&rsquo;s are more warmly
filled and more brightly touched by every return of morning and
evening, while the hues of the Gothic cathedrals have died like
the iris out of the cloud, and the temples, whose azure and
purple once flamed above the Grecian promontory, stand in their
faded whiteness like snows which the sunset has left
cold.&rsquo;&mdash;Ruskin, <i>Seven Lamps of Architecture</i>,

<p>I do not know anything so perfectly commonplace in design as
most modern jewellery.&nbsp; How easy for you to change that and
to produce goldsmiths&rsquo; work that would be a joy to all of
us.&nbsp; The gold is ready for you in unexhausted treasure,
stored up in the mountain hollow or strewn on the river sand, and
was not given to you merely for barren speculation.&nbsp; There
should be some better record of it left in your history than the
merchant&rsquo;s panic and the ruined home.&nbsp; We do not
remember often enough how constantly the history of a great
nation will live in and by its art.&nbsp; Only a few thin wreaths
of beaten gold remain to tell us of the stately empire of
Etruria; and, while from the streets of Florence the noble knight
and haughty duke have long since passed away, the gates which the
simple goldsmith Ghiberti made for their pleasure still guard
their lovely house of baptism, worthy still of the praise of
Michael Angelo who called them worthy to be the Gates of
Paradise.</p>
<p>Have then your school of design, search out your workmen and,
when you find one who has delicacy of hand and that wonder of
invention necessary for goldsmiths&rsquo; work, do not leave him
to toil in obscurity and dishonour and have a great glaring shop
and two great glaring shop-boys in it (not to take your orders:
they never do that; but to force you to buy something you do not
want at all).&nbsp; When you want a thing wrought in gold, goblet
or shield for the feast, necklace or wreath for the women, tell
him what you like most in decoration, flower or wreath, bird in
flight or hound in the chase, image of the woman you love or the
friend you honour.&nbsp; Watch him as he beats out the gold into
those thin plates delicate as the petals of a yellow rose, or
draws it into the long wires like tangled sunbeams at dawn.&nbsp;
Whoever that workman be, help him, cherish him, and you will have
such lovely work from his hand as will be a joy to you for all
time.</p>
<p>This is the spirit of our movement in England, and this is the
spirit in which we would wish you to work, making eternal by your
art all that is noble in your men and women, stately in your
lakes and mountains, beautiful in your own flowers and natural
life.&nbsp; We want to see that you have nothing in your houses
that has not been a joy to the man who made it, and is not a joy
to those that use it.&nbsp; We want to see you create an art made
by the hands of the people to please the hearts of the people
too.&nbsp; Do you like this spirit or not?&nbsp; Do you think it
simple and strong, noble in its aim, and beautiful in its
result?&nbsp; I know you do.</p>
<p>Folly and slander have their own way for a little time, but
for a little time only.&nbsp; You now know what we mean: you will
be able to estimate what is said of us&mdash;its value and its
motive.</p>
<p>There should be a law that no ordinary newspaper should be
allowed to write about art.&nbsp; The harm they do by their
foolish and random writing it would be impossible to
overestimate&mdash;not to the artist but to the public, blinding
them to all, but harming the artist not at all.&nbsp; Without
them we would judge a man simply by his work; but at present the
newspapers are trying hard to induce the public to judge a
sculptor, for instance, never by his statues but by the way he
treats his wife; a painter by the amount of his income and a poet
by the colour of his neck-tie.&nbsp; I said there should be a
law, but there is really no necessity for a new law: nothing
could be easier than to bring the ordinary critic under the head
of the criminal classes.&nbsp; But let us leave such an
inartistic subject and return to beautiful and comely things,
remembering that the art which would represent the spirit of
modern newspapers would be exactly the art which you and I want
to avoid&mdash;grotesque art, malice mocking you from every
gateway, slander sneering at you from every corner.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may be surprised at my talking of labour and the
workman.&nbsp; You have heard of me, I fear, through the medium
of your somewhat imaginative newspapers as, if not a
&lsquo;Japanese young man,&rsquo; at least a young man to whom
the rush and clamour and reality of the modern world were
distasteful, and whose greatest difficulty in life was the
difficulty of living up to the level of his blue china&mdash;a
paradox from which England has not yet recovered.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you how it first came to me at all to create
an artistic movement in England, a movement to show the rich what
beautiful things they might enjoy and the poor what beautiful
things they might create.</p>
<p>One summer afternoon in Oxford&mdash;&lsquo;that sweet city
with her dreaming spires,&rsquo; lovely as Venice in its
splendour, noble in its learning as Rome, down the long High
Street that winds from tower to tower, past silent cloister and
stately gateway, till it reaches that long, grey seven-arched
bridge which Saint Mary used to guard (used to, I say, because
they are now pulling it down to build a tramway and a light
cast-iron bridge in its place, desecrating the loveliest city in
England)&mdash;well, we were coming down the street&mdash;a troop
of young men, some of them like myself only nineteen, going to
river or tennis-court or cricket-field&mdash;when Ruskin going up
to lecture in cap and gown met us.&nbsp; He seemed troubled and
prayed us to go back with him to his lecture, which a few of us
did, and there he spoke to us not on art this time but on life,
saying that it seemed to him to be wrong that all the best
physique and strength of the young men in England should be spent
aimlessly on cricket ground or river, without any result at all
except that if one rowed well one got a pewter-pot, and if one
made a good score, a cane-handled bat.&nbsp; He thought, he said,
that we should be working at something that would do good to
other people, at something by which we might show that in all
labour there was something noble.&nbsp; Well, we were a good deal
moved, and said we would do anything he wished.&nbsp; So he went
out round Oxford and found two villages, Upper and Lower Hinksey,
and between them there lay a great swamp, so that the villagers
could not pass from one to the other without many miles of a
round.&nbsp; And when we came back in winter he asked us to help
him to make a road across this morass for these village people to
use.&nbsp; So out we went, day after day, and learned how to lay
levels and to break stones, and to wheel barrows along a
plank&mdash;a very difficult thing to do.&nbsp; And Ruskin worked
with us in the mist and rain and mud of an Oxford winter, and our
friends and our enemies came out and mocked us from the
bank.&nbsp; We did not mind it much then, and we did not mind it
afterwards at all, but worked away for two months at our
road.&nbsp; And what became of the road?&nbsp; Well, like a bad
lecture it ended abruptly&mdash;in the middle of the swamp.&nbsp;
Ruskin going away to Venice, when we came back for the next term
there was no leader, and the &lsquo;diggers,&rsquo; as they
called us, fell asunder.&nbsp; And I felt that if there was
enough spirit amongst the young men to go out to such work as
road-making for the sake of a noble ideal of life, I could from
them create an artistic movement that might change, as it has
changed, the face of England.&nbsp; So I sought them
out&mdash;leader they would call me&mdash;but there was no
leader: we were all searchers only and we were bound to each
other by noble friendship and by noble art.&nbsp; There was none
of us idle: poets most of us, so ambitious were we: painters some
of us, or workers in metal or modellers, determined that we would
try and create for ourselves beautiful work: for the
handicraftsman beautiful work, for those who love us poems and
pictures, for those who love us not epigrams and paradoxes and
scorn.</p>
<p>Well, we have done something in England and we will do
something more.&nbsp; Now, I do not want you, believe me, to ask
your brilliant young men, your beautiful young girls, to go out
and make a road on a swamp for any village in America, but I
think you might each of you have some art to practise.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We must have, as Emerson said, a mechanical craft for our
culture, a basis for our higher accomplishments in the work of
our hands&mdash;the uselessness of most people&rsquo;s hands
seems to me one of the most unpractical things.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
separation from labour can be without some loss of power or truth
to the seer,&rsquo; says Emerson again.&nbsp; The heroism which
would make on us the impression of Epaminondas must be that of a
domestic conqueror.&nbsp; The hero of the future is he who shall
bravely and gracefully subdue this Gorgon of fashion and of
convention.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your own part, abide by it, and do not
weakly try and reconcile yourself with the world.&nbsp; The
heroic cannot be the common nor the common the heroic.&nbsp;
Congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and
extravagant and broken the monotony of a decorous age.</p>
<p>And lastly, let us remember that art is the one thing which
Death cannot harm.&nbsp; The little house at Concord may be
desolate, but the wisdom of New England&rsquo;s Plato is not
silenced nor the brilliancy of that Attic genius dimmed: the lips
of Longfellow are still musical for us though his dust be turning
into the flowers which he loved: and as it is with the greater
artists, poet and philosopher and song-bird, so let it be with
you.</p>

197</span>LECTURE TO ART STUDENTS</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Delivered to the Art students of the Royal
Academy at their Club in Golden Square, Westminster, on June 30,
1883.&nbsp; The text is taken from the original manuscript.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the lecture which it is my
privilege to deliver before you to-night I do not desire to give
you any abstract definition of beauty at all.&nbsp; For we who
are working in art cannot accept any theory of beauty in exchange
for beauty itself, and, so far from desiring to isolate it in a
formula appealing to the intellect, we, on the contrary, seek to
materialise it in a form that gives joy to the soul through the
senses.&nbsp; We want to create it, not to define it.&nbsp; The
definition should follow the work: the work should not adapt
itself to the definition.</p>
<p>Nothing, indeed, is more dangerous to the young artist than
any conception of ideal beauty: he is constantly led by it either
into weak prettiness or lifeless abstraction: whereas to touch
the ideal at all you must not strip it of vitality.&nbsp; You
must find it in life and re-create it in art.</p>
<p>While, then, on the one hand I do not desire to give you any
philosophy of beauty&mdash;for, what I want to-night is to
investigate how we can create art, not how we can talk of
it&mdash;on the other hand, I do not wish to deal with anything
like a history of English art.</p>
<p>To begin with, such an expression as English art is a
meaningless expression.&nbsp; One might just as well talk of
English mathematics.&nbsp; Art is the science of beauty, and
Mathematics the science of truth: there is no national school of
either.&nbsp; Indeed, a national school is a provincial school,
merely.&nbsp; Nor is there any such thing as a school of art
even.&nbsp; There are merely artists, that is all.</p>
<p>And as regards histories of art, they are quite valueless to
you unless you are seeking the ostentatious oblivion of an art
professorship.&nbsp; It is of no use to you to know the date of
Perugino or the birthplace of Salvator Rosa: all that you should
learn about art is to know a good picture when you see it, and a
bad picture when you see it.&nbsp; As regards the date of the
artist, all good work looks perfectly modern: a piece of Greek
sculpture, a portrait of Velasquez&mdash;they are always modern,
always of our time.&nbsp; And as regards the nationality of the
artist, art is not national but universal.&nbsp; As regards
arch&aelig;ology, then, avoid it altogether: arch&aelig;ology is
merely the science of making excuses for bad art; it is the rock
on which many a young artist founders and shipwrecks; it is the
abyss from which no artist, old or young, ever returns.&nbsp; Or,
if he does return, he is so covered with the dust of ages and the
mildew of time, that he is quite unrecognisable as an artist, and
has to conceal himself for the rest of his days under the cap of
a professor, or as a mere illustrator of ancient history.&nbsp;
How worthless arch&aelig;ology is in art you can estimate by the
fact of its being so popular.&nbsp; Popularity is the crown of
laurel which the world puts on bad art.&nbsp; Whatever is popular
is wrong.</p>
<p>As I am not going to talk to you, then, about the philosophy
of the beautiful, or the history of art, you will ask me what I
am going to talk about.&nbsp; The subject of my lecture to-night
is what makes an artist and what does the artist make; what are
the relations of the artist to his surroundings, what is the
education the artist should get, and what is the quality of a
good work of art.</p>
<p>Now, as regards the relations of the artist to his
surroundings, by which I mean the age and country in which he is
born.&nbsp; All good art, as I said before, has nothing to do
with any particular century; but this universality is the quality
of the work of art; the conditions that produce that quality are
different.&nbsp; And what, I think, you should do is to realise
completely your age in order completely to abstract yourself from
it; remembering that if you are an artist at all, you will be not
the mouthpiece of a century, but the master of eternity, that all
art rests on a principle, and that mere temporal considerations
are no principle at all; and that those who advise you to make
your art representative of the nineteenth century are advising
you to produce an art which your children, when you have them,
will think old-fashioned.&nbsp; But you will tell me this is an
inartistic age, and we are an inartistic people, and the artist
suffers much in this nineteenth century of ours.</p>
<p>Of course he does.&nbsp; I, of all men, am not going to deny
that.&nbsp; But remember that there never has been an artistic
age, or an artistic people, since the beginning of the
world.&nbsp; The artist has always been, and will always be, an
exquisite exception.&nbsp; There is no golden age of art; only
artists who have produced what is more golden than gold.</p>
<p><i>What</i>, you will say to me, the Greeks? were not they an
artistic people?</p>
<p>Well, the Greeks certainly not, but, perhaps, you mean the
Athenians, the citizens of one out of a thousand cities.</p>
<p>Do you think that they were an artistic people?&nbsp; Take
them even at the time of their highest artistic development, the
latter part of the fifth century before Christ, when they had the
greatest poets and the greatest artists of the antique world,
when the Parthenon rose in loveliness at the bidding of a
Phidias, and the philosopher spake of wisdom in the shadow of the
painted portico, and tragedy swept in the perfection of pageant
and pathos across the marble of the stage.&nbsp; Were they an
artistic people then?&nbsp; Not a bit of it.&nbsp; What is an
artistic people but a people who love their artists and
understand their art?&nbsp; The Athenians could do neither.</p>
<p>How did they treat Phidias?&nbsp; To Phidias we owe the great
era, not merely in Greek, but in all art&mdash;I mean of the
introduction of the use of the living model.</p>
<p>And what would you say if all the English bishops, backed by
the English people, came down from Exeter Hall to the Royal
Academy one day and took off Sir Frederick Leighton in a prison
van to Newgate on the charge of having allowed you to make use of
the living model in your designs for sacred pictures?</p>
<p>Would you not cry out against the barbarism and the Puritanism
of such an idea?&nbsp; Would you not explain to them that the
worst way to honour God is to dishonour man who is made in His
image, and is the work of His hands; and, that if one wants to
paint Christ one must take the most Christlike person one can
find, and if one wants to paint the Madonna, the purest girl one
knows?</p>
<p>Would you not rush off and burn down Newgate, if necessary,
and say that such a thing was without parallel in history?</p>
<p>Without parallel?&nbsp; Well, that is exactly what the
Athenians did.</p>
<p>In the room of the Parthenon marbles, in the British Museum,
you will see a marble shield on the wall.&nbsp; On it there are
two figures; one of a man whose face is half hidden, the other of
a man with the godlike lineaments of Pericles.&nbsp; For having
done this, for having introduced into a bas relief, taken from
Greek sacred history, the image of the great statesman who was
ruling Athens at the time, Phidias was flung into prison and
there, in the common gaol of Athens, died, the supreme artist of
the old world.</p>
<p>And do you think that this was an exceptional case?&nbsp; The
sign of a Philistine age is the cry of immorality against art,
and this cry was raised by the Athenian people against every
great poet and thinker of their day&mdash;&AElig;schylus,
Euripides, Socrates.&nbsp; It was the same with Florence in the
thirteenth century.&nbsp; Good handicrafts are due to guilds, not
to the people.&nbsp; The moment the guilds lost their power and
the people rushed in, beauty and honesty of work died.</p>
<p>And so, never talk of an artistic people; there never has been
such a thing.</p>
<p>But, perhaps, you will tell me that the external beauty of the
world has almost entirely passed away from us, that the artist
dwells no longer in the midst of the lovely surroundings which,
in ages past, were the natural inheritance of every one, and that
art is very difficult in this unlovely town of ours, where, as
you go to your work in the morning, or return from it at
eventide, you have to pass through street after street of the
most foolish and stupid architecture that the world has ever
seen; architecture, where every lovely Greek form is desecrated
and defiled, and every lovely Gothic form defiled and desecrated,
reducing three-fourths of the London houses to being, merely,
like square boxes of the vilest proportions, as gaunt as they are
grimy, and as poor as they are pretentious&mdash;the hall door
always of the wrong colour, and the windows of the wrong size,
and where, even when wearied of the houses you turn to
contemplate the street itself, you have nothing to look at but
chimney-pot hats, men with sandwich boards, vermilion
letter-boxes, and do that even at the risk of being run over by
an emerald-green omnibus.</p>
<p>Is not art difficult, you will say to me, in such surroundings
as these?&nbsp; Of course it is difficult, but then art was never
easy; you yourselves would not wish it to be easy; and, besides,
nothing is worth doing except what the world says is
impossible.</p>
<p>Still, you do not care to be answered merely by a
paradox.&nbsp; What are the relations of the artist to the
external world, and what is the result of the loss of beautiful
surroundings to you, is one of the most important questions of
modern art; and there is no point on which Mr. Ruskin so insists
as that the decadence of art has come from the decadence of
beautiful things; and that when the artist cannot feed his eye on
beauty, beauty goes from his work.</p>
<p>I remember in one of his lectures, after describing the sordid
aspect of a great English city, he draws for us a picture of what
were the artistic surroundings long ago.</p>
<p>Think, he says, in words of perfect and picturesque imagery,
whose beauty I can but feebly echo, think of what was the scene
which presented itself, in his afternoon walk, to a designer of
the Gothic school of Pisa&mdash;Nino Pisano or any of his men: <a
name="citation206"></a><a href="#footnote206"
class="citation">[206]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>On each side of a bright river he saw rise a line
of brighter palaces, arched and pillared, and inlaid with deep
red porphyry, and with serpentine; along the quays before their
gates were riding troops of knights, noble in face and form,
dazzling in crest and shield; horse and man one labyrinth of
quaint colour and gleaming light&mdash;the purple, and silver,
and scarlet fringes flowing over the strong limbs and clashing
mall, like sea-waves over rocks at sunset.&nbsp; Opening on each
side from the river were gardens, courts, and cloisters; long
successions of white pillars among wreaths of vine; leaping of
fountains through buds of pomegranate and orange: and still along
the garden-paths, and under and through the crimson of the
pomegranate shadows, moving slowly, groups of the fairest women
that Italy ever saw&mdash;fairest, because purest and
thoughtfullest; trained in all high knowledge, as in all
courteous art&mdash;in dance, in song, in sweet wit, in lofty
learning, in loftier courage, in loftiest love&mdash;able alike
to cheer, to enchant, or save, the souls of men.&nbsp; Above all
this scenery of perfect human life, rose dome and bell-tower,
burning with white alabaster and gold: beyond dome and bell-tower
the slopes of mighty hills hoary with olive; far in the north,
above a purple sea of peaks of solemn Apennine, the clear,
sharp-cloven Carrara mountains sent up their steadfast flames of
marble summit into amber sky; the great sea itself, scorching
with expanse of light, stretching from their feet to the
Gorgonian isles; and over all these, ever present, near or
far&mdash;seen through the leaves of vine, or imaged with all its
march of clouds in the Arno&rsquo;s stream, or set with its depth
of blue close against the golden hair and burning cheek of lady
and knight,&mdash;that untroubled and sacred sky, which was to
all men, in those days of innocent faith, indeed the unquestioned
abode of spirits, as the earth was of men; and which opened
straight through its gates of cloud and veils of dew into the
awfulness of the eternal world;&mdash;a heaven in which every
cloud that passed was literally the chariot of an angel, and
every ray of its Evening and Morning streamed from the throne of
God.</p>
<p>What think you of that for a school of design?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then look at the depressing, monotonous appearance of any
modern city, the sombre dress of men and women, the meaningless
and barren architecture, the colourless and dreadful
surroundings.&nbsp; Without a beautiful national life, not
sculpture merely, but all the arts will die.</p>
<p>Well, as regards the religious feeling of the close of the
passage, I do not think I need speak about that.&nbsp; Religion
springs from religious feeling, art from artistic feeling: you
never get one from the other; unless you have the right root you
will not get the right flower; and, if a man sees in a cloud the
chariot of an angel, he will probably paint it very unlike a
cloud.</p>
<p>But, as regards the general idea of the early part of that
lovely bit of prose, is it really true that beautiful
surroundings are necessary for the artist?&nbsp; I think not; I
am sure not.&nbsp; Indeed, to me the most inartistic thing in
this age of ours is not the indifference of the public to
beautiful things, but the indifference of the artist to the
things that are called ugly.&nbsp; For, to the real artist,
nothing is beautiful or ugly in itself at all.&nbsp; With the
facts of the object he has nothing to do, but with its appearance
only, and appearance is a matter of light and shade, of masses,
of position, and of value.</p>
<p>Appearance is, in fact, a matter of effect merely, and it is
with the effects of nature that you have to deal, not with the
real condition of the object.&nbsp; What you, as painters, have
to paint is not things as they are but things as they seem to be,
not things as they are but things as they are not.</p>
<p>No object is so ugly that, under certain conditions of light
and shade, or proximity to other things, it will not look
beautiful; no object is so beautiful that, under certain
conditions, it will not look ugly.&nbsp; I believe that in every
twenty-four hours what is beautiful looks ugly, and what is ugly
looks beautiful, once.</p>
<p>And, the commonplace character of so much of our English
painting seems to me due to the fact that so many of our young
artists look merely at what we may call &lsquo;ready-made
beauty,&rsquo; whereas you exist as artists not to copy beauty
but to create it in your art, to wait and watch for it in
nature.</p>
<p>What would you say of a dramatist who would take nobody but
virtuous people as characters in his play?&nbsp; Would you not
say he was missing half of life?&nbsp; Well, of the young artist
who paints nothing but beautiful things, I say he misses one half
of the world.</p>
<p>Do not wait for life to be picturesque, but try and see life
under picturesque conditions.&nbsp; These conditions you can
create for yourself in your studio, for they are merely
conditions of light.&nbsp; In nature, you must wait for them,
watch for them, choose them; and, if you wait and watch, come
they will.</p>
<p>In Gower Street at night you may see a letter-box that is
picturesque: on the Thames Embankment you may see picturesque
policemen.&nbsp; Even Venice is not always beautiful, nor
France.</p>
<p>To paint what you see is a good rule in art, but to see what
is worth painting is better.&nbsp; See life under pictorial
conditions.&nbsp; It is better to live in a city of changeable
weather than in a city of lovely surroundings.</p>
<p>Now, having seen what makes the artist, and what the artist
makes, who is the artist?&nbsp; There is a man living amongst us
who unites in himself all the qualities of the noblest art, whose
work is a joy for all time, who is, himself, a master of all
time.&nbsp; That man is Mr. Whistler.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>But, you will say, modern dress, that is bad.&nbsp; If you
cannot paint black cloth you could not have painted silken
doublet.&nbsp; Ugly dress is better for art&mdash;facts of
vision, not of the object.</p>
<p>What is a picture?&nbsp; Primarily, a picture is a beautifully
coloured surface, merely, with no more spiritual message or
meaning for you than an exquisite fragment of Venetian glass or a
blue tile from the wall of Damascus.&nbsp; It is, primarily, a
purely decorative thing, a delight to look at.</p>
<p>All arch&aelig;ological pictures that make you say &lsquo;How
curious!&rsquo; all sentimental pictures that make you say,
&lsquo;How sad!&rsquo; all historical pictures that make you say
&lsquo;How interesting!&rsquo; all pictures that do not
immediately give you such artistic joy as to make you say
&lsquo;How beautiful!&rsquo; are bad pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>We never know what an artist is going to do.&nbsp; Of course
not.&nbsp; The artist is not a specialist.&nbsp; All such
divisions as animal painters, landscape painters, painters of
Scotch cattle in an English mist, painters of English cattle in a
Scotch mist, racehorse painters, bull-terrier painters, all are
shallow.&nbsp; If a man is an artist he can paint everything.</p>
<p>The object of art is to stir the most divine and remote of the
chords which make music in our soul; and colour is indeed, of
itself a mystical presence on things, and tone a kind of
sentinel.</p>
<p>Am I pleading, then, for mere technique?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; As
long as there are any signs of technique at all, the picture is
unfinished.&nbsp; What is finish?&nbsp; A picture is finished
when all traces of work, and of the means employed to bring about
the result, have disappeared.</p>
<p>In the case of handicraftsmen&mdash;the weaver, the potter,
the smith&mdash;on their work are the traces of their hand.&nbsp;
But it is not so with the painter; it is not so with the
artist.</p>
<p>Art should have no sentiment about it but its beauty, no
technique except what you cannot observe.&nbsp; One should be
able to say of a picture not that it is &lsquo;well
painted,&rsquo; but that it is &lsquo;not painted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What is the difference between absolutely decorative art and a
painting?&nbsp; Decorative art emphasises its material:
imaginative art annihilates it.&nbsp; Tapestry shows its threads
as part of its beauty: a picture annihilates its canvas: it shows
nothing of it.&nbsp; Porcelain emphasises its glaze:
water-colours reject the paper.</p>
<p>A picture has no meaning but its beauty, no message but its
joy.&nbsp; That is the first truth about art that you must never
lose sight of.&nbsp; A picture is a purely decorative thing.</p>

213</span>LONDON MODELS</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>English Illustrated Magazine</i>, January
1889.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Professional</span> models are a purely
modern invention.&nbsp; To the Greeks, for instance, they were
quite unknown.&nbsp; Mr. Mahaffy, it is true, tells us that
Pericles used to present peacocks to the great ladies of Athenian
society in order to induce them to sit to his friend Phidias, and
we know that Polygnotus introduced into his picture of the Trojan
women the face of Elpinice, the celebrated sister of the great
Conservative leader of the day, but these <i>grandes dames</i>
clearly do not come under our category.&nbsp; As for the old
masters, they undoubtedly made constant studies from their pupils
and apprentices, and even their religious pictures are full of
the portraits of their friends and relations, but they do not
seem to have had the inestimable advantage of the existence of a
class of people whose sole profession is to pose.&nbsp; In fact
the model, in our sense of the word, is the direct creation of
Academic Schools.</p>
<p>Every country now has its own models, except America.&nbsp; In
New York, and even in Boston, a good model is so great a rarity
that most of the artists are reduced to painting Niagara and
millionaires.&nbsp; In Europe, however, it is different.&nbsp;
Here we have plenty of models, and of every nationality.&nbsp;
The Italian models are the best.&nbsp; The natural grace of their
attitudes, as well as the wonderful picturesqueness of their
colouring, makes them facile&mdash;often too
facile&mdash;subjects for the painter&rsquo;s brush.&nbsp; The
French models, though not so beautiful as the Italian, possess a
quickness of intellectual sympathy, a capacity, in fact, of
understanding the artist, which is quite remarkable.&nbsp; They
have also a great command over the varieties of facial
expression, are peculiarly dramatic, and can chatter the
<i>argot</i> of the <i>atelier</i> as cleverly as the critic of
the <i>Gil Blas</i>.&nbsp; The English models form a class
entirely by themselves.&nbsp; They are not so picturesque as the
Italian, nor so clever as the French, and they have absolutely no
tradition, so to speak, of their order.&nbsp; Now and then some
old veteran knocks at the studio door, and proposes to sit as
Ajax defying the lightning, or as King Lear upon the blasted
heath.&nbsp; One of them some time ago called on a popular
painter who, happening at the moment to require his services,
engaged him, and told him to begin by kneeling down in the
attitude of prayer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall I be Biblical or
Shakespearean, sir?&rsquo; asked the veteran.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well&mdash;Shakespearean,&rsquo; answered the artist,
wondering by what subtle <i>nuance</i> of expression the model
would convey the difference.&nbsp; &lsquo;All right, sir,&rsquo;
said the professor of posing, and he solemnly knelt down and
began to wink with his left eye!&nbsp; This class, however, is
dying out.&nbsp; As a rule the model, nowadays, is a pretty girl,
from about twelve to twenty-five years of age, who knows nothing
about art, cares less, and is merely anxious to earn seven or
eight shillings a day without much trouble.&nbsp; English models
rarely look at a picture, and never venture on any &aelig;sthetic
theories.&nbsp; In fact, they realise very completely Mr.
Whistler&rsquo;s idea of the function of an art critic, for they
pass no criticisms at all.&nbsp; They accept all schools of art
with the grand catholicity of the auctioneer, and sit to a
fantastic young impressionist as readily as to a learned and
laborious academician.&nbsp; They are neither for the
Whistlerites nor against them; the quarrel between the school of
facts and the school of effects touches them not; idealistic and
naturalistic are words that convey no meaning to their ears; they
merely desire that the studio shall be warm, and the lunch hot,
for all charming artists give their models lunch.</p>
<p>As to what they are asked to do they are equally
indifferent.&nbsp; On Monday they will don the rags of a
beggar-girl for Mr. Pumper, whose pathetic pictures of modern
life draw such tears from the public, and on Tuesday they will
pose in a peplum for Mr. Phoebus, who thinks that all really
artistic subjects are necessarily <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>&nbsp; They career gaily through all
centuries and through all costumes, and, like actors, are
interesting only when they are not themselves.&nbsp; They are
extremely good-natured, and very accommodating.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
do you sit for?&rsquo; said a young artist to a model who had
sent him in her card (all models, by the way, have cards and a
small black bag).&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, for anything you like,
sir,&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;landscape if
necessary!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Intellectually, it must be acknowledged, they are Philistines,
but physically they are perfect&mdash;at least some are.&nbsp;
Though none of them can talk Greek, many can look Greek, which to
a nineteenth-century painter is naturally of great
importance.&nbsp; If they are allowed, they chatter a great deal,
but they never say anything.&nbsp; Their observations are the
only <i>banalit&eacute;s</i> heard in Bohemia.&nbsp; However,
though they cannot appreciate the artist as artist, they are
quite ready to appreciate the artist as a man.&nbsp; They are
very sensitive to kindness, respect and generosity.&nbsp; A
beautiful model who had sat for two years to one of our most
distinguished English painters, got engaged to a street vendor of
penny ices.</p>
<p>On her marriage the painter sent her a pretty wedding present,
and received in return a nice letter of thanks with the following
remarkable postscript: &lsquo;Never eat the green
ices!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they are tired a wise artist gives them a rest.&nbsp;
Then they sit in a chair and read penny dreadfuls, till they are
roused from the tragedy of literature to take their place again
in the tragedy of art.&nbsp; A few of them smoke
cigarettes.&nbsp; This, however, is regarded by the other models
as showing a want of seriousness, and is not generally approved
of.&nbsp; They are engaged by the day and by the half-day.&nbsp;
The tariff is a shilling an hour, to which great artists usually
add an omnibus fare.&nbsp; The two best things about them are
their extraordinary prettiness, and their extreme
respectability.&nbsp; As a class they are very well behaved,
particularly those who sit for the figure, a fact which is
curious or natural according to the view one takes of human
nature.&nbsp; They usually marry well, and sometimes they marry
the artist.&nbsp; For an artist to marry his model is as fatal as
for a <i>gourmet</i> to marry his cook: the one gets no sittings,
and the other gets no dinners.</p>
<p>On the whole the English female models are very na&iuml;ve,
very natural, and very good-humoured.&nbsp; The virtues which the
artist values most in them are prettiness and punctuality.&nbsp;
Every sensible model consequently keeps a diary of her
engagements, and dresses neatly.&nbsp; The bad season is, of
course, the summer, when the artists are out of town.&nbsp;
However, of late years some artists have engaged their models to
follow them, and the wife of one of our most charming painters
has often had three or four models under her charge in the
country, so that the work of her husband and his friends should
not be interrupted.&nbsp; In France the models migrate <i>en
masse</i> to the little seaport villages or forest hamlets where
the painters congregate.&nbsp; The English models, however, wait
patiently in London, as a rule, till the artists come back.&nbsp;
Nearly all of them live with their parents, and help to support
the house.&nbsp; They have every qualification for being
immortalised in art except that of beautiful hands.&nbsp; The
hands of the English model are nearly always coarse and red.</p>
<p>As for the male models, there is the veteran whom we have
mentioned above.&nbsp; He has all the traditions of the grand
style, and is rapidly disappearing with the school he
represents.&nbsp; An old man who talks about Fuseli is, of
course, unendurable, and, besides, patriarchs have ceased to be
fashionable subjects.&nbsp; Then there is the true Academy
model.&nbsp; He is usually a man of thirty, rarely good-looking,
but a perfect miracle of muscles.&nbsp; In fact he is the
apotheosis of anatomy, and is so conscious of his own splendour
that he tells you of his tibia and his thorax, as if no one else
had anything of the kind.&nbsp; Then come the Oriental
models.&nbsp; The supply of these is limited, but there are
always about a dozen in London.&nbsp; They are very much sought
after as they can remain immobile for hours, and generally
possess lovely costumes.&nbsp; However, they have a very poor
opinion of English art, which they regard as something between a
vulgar personality and a commonplace photograph.&nbsp; Next we
have the Italian youth who has come over specially to be a model,
or takes to it when his organ is out of repair.&nbsp; He is often
quite charming with his large melancholy eyes, his crisp hair,
and his slim brown figure.&nbsp; It is true he eats garlic, but
then he can stand like a faun and couch like a leopard, so he is
forgiven.&nbsp; He is always full of pretty compliments, and has
been known to have kind words of encouragement for even our
greatest artists.&nbsp; As for the English lad of the same age,
he never sits at all.&nbsp; Apparently he does not regard the
career of a model as a serious profession.&nbsp; In any case he
is rarely, if ever, to be got hold of.&nbsp; English boys, too,
are difficult to find.&nbsp; Sometimes an ex-model who has a son
will curl his hair, and wash his face, and bring him the round of
the studios, all soap and shininess.&nbsp; The young school
don&rsquo;t like him, but the older school do, and when he
appears on the walls of the Royal Academy he is called <i>The
Infant Samuel</i>.&nbsp; Occasionally also an artist catches a
couple of <i>gamins</i> in the gutter and asks them to come to
his studio.&nbsp; The first time they always appear, but after
that they don&rsquo;t keep their appointments.&nbsp; They dislike
sitting still, and have a strong and perhaps natural objection to
looking pathetic.&nbsp; Besides, they are always under the
impression that the artist is laughing at them.&nbsp; It is a sad
fact, but there is no doubt that the poor are completely
unconscious of their own picturesqueness.&nbsp; Those of them who
can be induced to sit do so with the idea that the artist is
merely a benevolent philanthropist who has chosen an eccentric
method of distributing alms to the undeserving.&nbsp; Perhaps the
School Board will teach the London <i>gamin</i> his own artistic
value, and then they will be better models than they are
now.&nbsp; One remarkable privilege belongs to the Academy model,
that of extorting a sovereign from any newly elected Associate or
R.A.&nbsp; They wait at Burlington House till the announcement is
made, and then race to the hapless artist&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
The one who arrives first receives the money.&nbsp; They have of
late been much troubled at the long distances they have had to
run, and they look with disfavour on the election of artists who
live at Hampstead or at Bedford Park, for it is considered a
point of honour not to employ the underground railway, omnibuses,
or any artificial means of locomotion.&nbsp; The race is to the
swift.</p>
<p>Besides the professional posers of the studio there are posers
of the Row, the posers at afternoon teas, the posers in politics
and the circus posers.&nbsp; All four classes are delightful, but
only the last class is ever really decorative.&nbsp; Acrobats and
gymnasts can give the young painter infinite suggestions, for
they bring into their art an element of swiftness of motion and
of constant change that the studio model necessarily lacks.&nbsp;
What is interesting in these &lsquo;slaves of the ring&rsquo; is
that with them Beauty is an unconscious result not a conscious
aim, the result in fact of the mathematical calculation of curves
and distances, of absolute precision of eye, of the scientific
knowledge of the equilibrium of forces, and of perfect physical
training.&nbsp; A good acrobat is always graceful, though grace
is never his object; he is graceful because he does what he has
to do in the best way in which it can be done&mdash;graceful
because he is natural.&nbsp; If an ancient Greek were to come to
life now, which considering the probable severity of his
criticisms would be rather trying to our conceit, he would be
found far oftener at the circus than at the theatre.&nbsp; A good
circus is an oasis of Hellenism in a world that reads too much to
be wise, and thinks too much to be beautiful.&nbsp; If it were
not for the running-ground at Eton, the towing-path at Oxford,
the Thames swimming-baths, and the yearly circuses, humanity
would forget the plastic perfection of its own form, and
degenerate into a race of short-sighted professors and spectacled
<i>pr&eacute;cieuses</i>.&nbsp; Not that the circus proprietors
are, as a rule, conscious of their high mission.&nbsp; Do they
not bore us with the <i>haute &eacute;cole</i>, and weary us with
Shakespearean clowns?&nbsp; Still, at least, they give us
acrobats, and the acrobat is an artist.&nbsp; The mere fact that
he never speaks to the audience shows how well he appreciates the
great truth that the aim of art is not to reveal personality but
to please.&nbsp; The clown may be blatant, but the acrobat is
always beautiful.&nbsp; He is an interesting combination of the
spirit of Greek sculpture with the spangles of the modern
costumier.&nbsp; He has even had his niche in the novels of our
age, and if <i>Manette Salomon</i> be the unmasking of the model,
<i>Les Fr&egrave;res Zemganno</i> is the apotheosis of the
acrobat.</p>
<p>As regards the influence of the ordinary model on our English
school of painting, it cannot be said that it is altogether
good.&nbsp; It is, of course, an advantage for the young artist
sitting in his studio to be able to isolate &lsquo;a little
corner of life,&rsquo; as the French say, from disturbing
surroundings, and to study it under certain effects of light and
shade.&nbsp; But this very isolation leads often to mere
mannerism in the painter, and robs him of that broad acceptance
of the general facts of life which is the very essence of
art.&nbsp; Model-painting, in a word, while it may be the
condition of art, is not by any means its aim.</p>
<p>It is simply practice, not perfection.&nbsp; Its use trains
the eye and the hand of the painter, its abuse produces in his
work an effect of mere posing and prettiness.&nbsp; It is the
secret of much of the artificiality of modern art, this constant
posing of pretty people, and when art becomes artificial it
becomes monotonous.&nbsp; Outside the little world of the studio,
with its draperies and its <i>bric-&agrave;-brac</i>, lies the
world of life with its infinite, its Shakespearean variety.&nbsp;
We must, however, distinguish between the two kinds of models,
those who sit for the figure and those who sit for the
costume.&nbsp; The study of the first is always excellent, but
the costume-model is becoming rather wearisome in modern
pictures.&nbsp; It is really of very little use to dress up a
London girl in Greek draperies and to paint her as a
goddess.&nbsp; The robe may be the robe of Athens, but the face
is usually the face of Brompton.&nbsp; Now and then, it is true,
one comes across a model whose face is an exquisite anachronism,
and who looks lovely and natural in the dress of any century but
her own.&nbsp; This, however, is rather rare.&nbsp; As a rule
models are absolutely <i>de notre si&egrave;cle</i>, and should
be painted as such.&nbsp; Unfortunately they are not, and, as a
consequence, we are shown every year a series of scenes from
fancy dress balls which are called historical pictures, but are
little more than mediocre representations of modern people
masquerading.&nbsp; In France they are wiser.&nbsp; The French
painter uses the model simply for study; for the finished picture
he goes direct to life.</p>
<p>However, we must not blame the sitters for the shortcomings of
the artists.&nbsp; The English models are a well-behaved and
hard-working class, and if they are more interested in artists
than in art, a large section of the public is in the same
condition, and most of our modern exhibitions seem to justify its
choice.</p>

227</span>POEMS IN PROSE</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Fortnight Review</i>, July 1894.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Artist</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening there came into his
soul the desire to fashion an image of <i>The Pleasure that
abideth for a Moment</i>.&nbsp; And he went forth into the world
to look for bronze.&nbsp; For he could think only in bronze.</p>
<p>But all the bronze of the whole world had disappeared, nor
anywhere in the whole world was there any bronze to be found,
save only the bronze of the image of <i>The Sorrow that endureth
for Ever</i>.</p>
<p>Now this image he had himself, and with his own hands,
fashioned, and had set it on the tomb of the one thing he had
loved in life.&nbsp; On the tomb of the dead thing he had most
loved had he set this image of his own fashioning, that it might
serve as a sign of the love of man that dieth not, and a symbol
of the sorrow of man that endureth for ever.&nbsp; And in the
whole world there was no other bronze save the bronze of this
image.</p>
<p>And he took the image he had fashioned, and set it in a great
furnace, and gave it to the fire.</p>
<p>And out of the bronze of the image of <i>The Sorrow that
endureth for Ever</i> he fashioned an image of <i>The Pleasure
that abideth for a Moment</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Doer of Good</span></h3>
<p>It was night-time and He was alone.</p>
<p>And He saw afar-off the walls of a round city and went towards
the city.</p>
<p>And when He came near He heard within the city the tread of
the feet of joy, and the laughter of the mouth of gladness and
the loud noise of many lutes.&nbsp; And He knocked at the gate
and certain of the gate-keepers opened to Him.</p>
<p>And He beheld a house that was of marble and had fair pillars
of marble before it.&nbsp; The pillars were hung with garlands,
and within and without there were torches of cedar.&nbsp; And He
entered the house.</p>
<p>And when He had passed through the hall of chalcedony and the
hall of jasper, and reached the long hall of feasting, He saw
lying on a couch of sea-purple one whose hair was crowned with
red roses and whose lips were red with wine.</p>
<p>And He went behind him and touched him on the shoulder and
said to him, &lsquo;Why do you live like this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the young man turned round and recognised Him, and made
answer and said, &lsquo;But I was a leper once, and you healed
me.&nbsp; How else should I live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And He passed out of the house and went again into the
street.</p>
<p>And after a little while He saw one whose face and raiment
were painted and whose feet were shod with pearls.&nbsp; And
behind her came, slowly as a hunter, a young man who wore a cloak
of two colours.&nbsp; Now the face of the woman was as the fair
face of an idol, and the eyes of the young man were bright with
lust.</p>
<p>And He followed swiftly and touched the hand of the young man
and said to him, &lsquo;Why do you look at this woman and in such
wise?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the young man turned round and recognised Him and said,
&lsquo;But I was blind once, and you gave me sight.&nbsp; At what
else should I look?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And He ran forward and touched the painted raiment of the
woman and said to her, &lsquo;Is there no other way in which to
walk save the way of sin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the woman turned round and recognised Him, and laughed and
said, &lsquo;But you forgave me my sins, and the way is a
pleasant way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And He passed out of the city.</p>
<p>And when He had passed out of the city He saw seated by the
roadside a young man who was weeping.</p>
<p>And He went towards him and touched the long locks of his hair
and said to him, &lsquo;Why are you weeping?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the young man looked up and recognised Him and made
answer, &lsquo;But I was dead once, and you raised me from the
dead.&nbsp; What else should I do but weep?&rsquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Disciple</span></h3>
<p>When Narcissus died the pool of his pleasure changed from a
cup of sweet waters into a cup of salt tears, and the Oreads came
weeping through the woodland that they might sing to the pool and
give it comfort.</p>
<p>And when they saw that the pool had changed from a cup of
sweet waters into a cup of salt tears, they loosened the green
tresses of their hair and cried to the pool and said, &lsquo;We
do not wonder that you should mourn in this manner for Narcissus,
so beautiful was he.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But was Narcissus beautiful?&rsquo; said the pool.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who should know that better than you?&rsquo; answered
the Oreads.&nbsp; &lsquo;Us did he ever pass by, but you he
sought for, and would lie on your banks and look down at you, and
in the mirror of your waters he would mirror his own
beauty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the pool answered, &lsquo;But I loved Narcissus because,
as he lay on my banks and looked down at me, in the mirror of his
eyes I saw ever my own beauty mirrored.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Master</span></h3>
<p>Now when the darkness came over the earth Joseph of Arimathea,
having lighted a torch of pinewood, passed down from the hill
into the valley.&nbsp; For he had business in his own home.</p>
<p>And kneeling on the flint stones of the Valley of Desolation
he saw a young man who was naked and weeping.&nbsp; His hair was
the colour of honey, and his body was as a white flower, but he
had wounded his body with thorns and on his hair had he set ashes
as a crown.</p>
<p>And he who had great possessions said to the young man who was
naked and weeping, &lsquo;I do not wonder that your sorrow is so
great, for surely He was a just man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the young man answered, &lsquo;It is not for Him that I am
weeping, but for myself.&nbsp; I too have changed water into
wine, and I have healed the leper and given sight to the
blind.&nbsp; I have walked upon the waters, and from the dwellers
in the tombs I have cast out devils.&nbsp; I have fed the hungry
in the desert where there was no food, and I have raised the dead
from their narrow houses, and at my bidding, and before a great
multitude, of people, a barren fig-tree withered away.&nbsp; All
things that this man has done I have done also.&nbsp; And yet
they have not crucified me.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The House of Judgment</span></h3>
<p>And there was silence in the House of Judgment, and the Man
came naked before God.</p>
<p>And God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.</p>
<p>And God said to the Man, &lsquo;Thy life hath been evil, and
thou hast shown cruelty to those who were in need of succour, and
to those who lacked help thou hast been bitter and hard of
heart.&nbsp; The poor called to thee and thou didst not hearken,
and thine ears were closed to the cry of My afflicted.&nbsp; The
inheritance of the fatherless thou didst take unto thyself, and
thou didst send the foxes into the vineyard of thy
neighbour&rsquo;s field.&nbsp; Thou didst take the bread of the
children and give it to the dogs to eat, and My lepers who lived
in the marshes, and were at peace and praised Me, thou didst
drive forth on to the highways, and on Mine earth out of which I
made thee thou didst spill innocent blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the Man made answer and said, &lsquo;Even so did
I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And again God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.</p>
<p>And God said to the Man, &lsquo;Thy life hath been evil, and
the Beauty I have shown thou hast sought for, and the Good I have
hidden thou didst pass by.&nbsp; The walls of thy chamber were
painted with images, and from the bed of thine abominations thou
didst rise up to the sound of flutes.&nbsp; Thou didst build
seven altars to the sins I have suffered, and didst eat of the
thing that may not be eaten, and the purple of thy raiment was
broidered with the three signs of shame.&nbsp; Thine idols were
neither of gold nor of silver that endure, but of flesh that
dieth.&nbsp; Thou didst stain their hair with perfumes and put
pomegranates in their hands.&nbsp; Thou didst stain their feet
with saffron and spread carpets before them.&nbsp; With antimony
thou didst stain their eyelids and their bodies thou didst smear
with myrrh.&nbsp; Thou didst bow thyself to the ground before
them, and the thrones of thine idols were set in the sun.&nbsp;
Thou didst show to the sun thy shame and to the moon thy
madness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the Man made answer and said, &lsquo;Even so did
I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And a third time God opened the Book of the Life of the
Man.</p>
<p>And God said to the Man, &lsquo;Evil hath been thy life, and
with evil didst thou requite good, and with wrongdoing
kindness.&nbsp; The hands that fed thee thou didst wound, and the
breasts that gave thee suck thou didst despise.&nbsp; He who came
to thee with water went away thirsting, and the outlawed men who
hid thee in their tents at night thou didst betray before
dawn.&nbsp; Thine enemy who spared thee thou didst snare in an
ambush, and the friend who walked with thee thou didst sell for a
price, and to those who brought thee Love thou didst ever give
Lust in thy turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the Man made answer and said, &lsquo;Even so did
I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And God closed the Book of the Life of the Man, and said,
&lsquo;Surely I will send thee into Hell.&nbsp; Even into Hell
will I send thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the Man cried out, &lsquo;Thou canst not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And God said to the Man, &lsquo;Wherefore can I not send thee
to Hell, and for what reason?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because in Hell have I always lived,&rsquo; answered
the Man.</p>
<p>And there was silence in the House of Judgment.</p>
<p>And after a space God spake, and said to the Man,
&lsquo;Seeing that I may not send thee into Hell, surely I will
send thee unto Heaven.&nbsp; Even unto Heaven will I send
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the Man cried out, &lsquo;Thou canst not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And God said to the Man, &lsquo;Wherefore can I not send thee
unto Heaven, and for what reason?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because never, and in no place, have I been able to
imagine it,&rsquo; answered the Man.</p>
<p>And there was silence in the House of Judgment.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Teacher of Wisdom</span></h3>
<p>From his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect
knowledge of God, and even while he was yet but a lad many of the
saints, as well as certain holy women who dwelt in the free city
of his birth, had been stirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom
of his answers.</p>
<p>And when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of
manhood he kissed them, and left them and went out into the
world, that he might speak to the world about God.&nbsp; For
there were at that time many in the world who either knew not God
at all, or had but an incomplete knowledge of Him, or worshipped
the false gods who dwell in groves and have no care of their
worshippers.</p>
<p>And he set his face to the sun and journeyed, walking without
sandals, as he had seen the saints walk, and carrying at his
girdle a leathern wallet and a little water-bottle of burnt
clay.</p>
<p>And as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that
comes from the perfect knowledge of God, and he sang praises unto
God without ceasing; and after a time he reached a strange land
in which there were many cities.</p>
<p>And he passed through eleven cities.&nbsp; And some of these
cities were in valleys, and others were by the banks of great
rivers, and others were set on hills.&nbsp; And in each city he
found a disciple who loved him and followed him, and a great
multitude also of people followed him from each city, and the
knowledge of God spread in the whole land, and many of the rulers
were converted, and the priests of the temples in which there
were idols found that half of their gain was gone, and when they
beat upon their drums at noon none, or but a few, came with
peacocks and with offerings of flesh as had been the custom of
the land before his coming.</p>
<p>Yet the more the people followed him, and the greater the
number of his disciples, the greater became his sorrow.&nbsp; And
he knew not why his sorrow was so great.&nbsp; For he spake ever
about God, and out of the fulness of that perfect knowledge of
God which God had Himself given to him.</p>
<p>And one evening he passed out of the eleventh city, which was
a city of Armenia, and his disciples and a great crowd of people
followed after him; and he went up on to a mountain and sat down
on a rock that was on the mountain, and his disciples stood round
him, and the multitude knelt in the valley.</p>
<p>And he bowed his head on his hands and wept, and said to his
Soul, &lsquo;Why is it that I am full of sorrow and fear, and
that each of my disciples is an enemy that walks in the
noonday?&rsquo;&nbsp; And his Soul answered him and said,
&lsquo;God filled thee with the perfect knowledge of Himself, and
thou hast given this knowledge away to others.&nbsp; The pearl of
great price thou hast divided, and the vesture without seam thou
hast parted asunder.&nbsp; He who giveth away wisdom robbeth
himself.&nbsp; He is as one who giveth his treasure to a
robber.&nbsp; Is not God wiser than thou art?&nbsp; Who art thou
to give away the secret that God hath told thee?&nbsp; I was rich
once, and thou hast made me poor.&nbsp; Once I saw God, and now
thou hast hidden Him from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he wept again, for he knew that his Soul spake truth to
him, and that he had given to others the perfect knowledge of
God, and that he was as one clinging to the skirts of God, and
that his faith was leaving him by reason of the number of those
who believed in him.</p>
<p>And he said to himself, &lsquo;I will talk no more about
God.&nbsp; He who giveth away wisdom robbeth himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And after the space of some hours his disciples came near him
and bowed themselves to the ground and said, &lsquo;Master, talk
to us about God, for thou hast the perfect knowledge of God, and
no man save thee hath this knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he answered them and said, &lsquo;I will talk to you about
all other things that are in heaven and on earth, but about God I
will not talk to you.&nbsp; Neither now, nor at any time, will I
talk to you about God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And they were wroth with him and said to him, &lsquo;Thou hast
led us into the desert that we might hearken to thee.&nbsp; Wilt
thou send us away hungry, and the great multitude that thou hast
made to follow thee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he answered them and said, &lsquo;I will not talk to you
about God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the multitude murmured against him and said to him,
&lsquo;Thou hast led us into the desert, and hast given us no
food to eat.&nbsp; Talk to us about God and it will suffice
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he answered them not a word.&nbsp; For he knew that if he
spake to them about God he would give away his treasure.</p>
<p>And his disciples went away sadly, and the multitude of people
returned to their own homes.&nbsp; And many died on the way.</p>
<p>And when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon,
and journeyed for seven moons, speaking to no man nor making any
answer.&nbsp; And when the seventh moon had waned he reached that
desert which is the desert of the Great River.&nbsp; And having
found a cavern in which a Centaur had once dwelt, he took it for
his place of dwelling, and made himself a mat of reeds on which
to lie, and became a hermit.&nbsp; And every hour the Hermit
praised God that He had suffered him to keep some knowledge of
Him and of His wonderful greatness.</p>
<p>Now, one evening, as the Hermit was seated before the cavern
in which he had made his place of dwelling, he beheld a young man
of evil and beautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with
empty hands.&nbsp; Every evening with empty hands the young man
passed by, and every morning he returned with his hands full of
purple and pearls.&nbsp; For he was a Robber and robbed the
caravans of the merchants.</p>
<p>And the Hermit looked at him and pitied him.&nbsp; But he
spake not a word.&nbsp; For he knew that he who speaks a word
loses his faith.</p>
<p>And one morning, as the young man returned with his hands full
of purple and pearls, he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot
upon the sand, and said to the Hermit: &lsquo;Why do you look at
me ever in this manner as I pass by?&nbsp; What is it that I see
in your eyes?&nbsp; For no man has looked at me before in this
manner.&nbsp; And the thing is a thorn and a trouble to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the Hermit answered him and said, &lsquo;What you see in
my eyes is pity.&nbsp; Pity is what looks out at you from my
eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the young man laughed with scorn, and cried to the Hermit
in a bitter voice, and said to him, &lsquo;I have purple and
pearls in my hands, and you have but a mat of reeds on which to
lie.&nbsp; What pity should you have for me?&nbsp; And for what
reason have you this pity?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have pity for you,&rsquo; said the Hermit,
&lsquo;because you have no knowledge of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this knowledge of God a precious thing?&rsquo; asked
the young man, and he came close to the mouth of the cavern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is more precious than all the purple and the pearls
of the world,&rsquo; answered the Hermit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And have you got it?&rsquo; said the young Robber, and
he came closer still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once, indeed,&rsquo; answered the Hermit, &lsquo;I
possessed the perfect knowledge of God.&nbsp; But in my
foolishness I parted with it, and divided it amongst
others.&nbsp; Yet even now is such knowledge as remains to me
more precious than purple or pearls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when the young Robber heard this he threw away the purple
and the pearls that he was bearing in his hands, and drawing a
sharp sword of curved steel he said to the Hermit, &lsquo;Give
me, forthwith this knowledge of God that you possess, or I will
surely slay you.&nbsp; Wherefore should I not slay him who has a
treasure greater than my treasure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the Hermit spread out his arms and said, &lsquo;Were it
not better for me to go unto the uttermost courts of God and
praise Him, than to live in the world and have no knowledge of
Him?&nbsp; Slay me if that be your desire.&nbsp; But I will not
give away my knowledge of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the young Robber knelt down and besought him, but the
Hermit would not talk to him about God, nor give him his
Treasure, and the young Robber rose up and said to the Hermit,
&lsquo;Be it as you will.&nbsp; As for myself, I will go to the
City of the Seven Sins, that is but three days&rsquo; journey
from this place, and for my purple they will give me pleasure,
and for my pearls they will sell me joy.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he took
up the purple and the pearls and went swiftly away.</p>
<p>And the Hermit cried out and followed him and besought
him.&nbsp; For the space of three days he followed the young
Robber on the road and entreated him to return, nor to enter into
the City of the Seven Sins.</p>
<p>And ever and anon the young Robber looked back at the Hermit
and called to him, and said, &lsquo;Will you give me this
knowledge of God which is more precious than purple and
pearls?&nbsp; If you will give me that, I will not enter the
city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And ever did the Hermit answer, &lsquo;All things that I have
I will give thee, save that one thing only.&nbsp; For that thing
it is not lawful for me to give away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the
great scarlet gates of the City of the Seven Sins.&nbsp; And from
the city there came the sound of much laughter.</p>
<p>And the young Robber laughed in answer, and sought to knock at
the gate.&nbsp; And as he did so the Hermit ran forward and
caught him by the skirts of his raiment, and said to him:
&lsquo;Stretch forth your hands, and set your arms around my
neck, and put your ear close to my lips, and I will give you what
remains to me of the knowledge of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the young
Robber stopped.</p>
<p>And when the Hermit had given away his knowledge of God, he
fell upon the ground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him
the city and the young Robber, so that he saw them no more.</p>
<p>And as he lay there weeping he was ware of One who was
standing beside him; and He who was standing beside him had feet
of brass and hair like fine wool.&nbsp; And He raised the Hermit
up, and said to him: &lsquo;Before this time thou hadst the
perfect knowledge of God.&nbsp; Now thou shalt have the perfect
love of God.&nbsp; Wherefore art thou weeping?&rsquo;&nbsp; And
he kissed him.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
